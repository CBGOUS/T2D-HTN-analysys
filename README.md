# Dataset Analysis

 
1. Cleaning

We started the cleaning process by identifying any duplicate entries in the dataset.  We also corrected any errors in 
the dataset, such as missing or incorrect values. We used the Z-Score methodology. We used this methodology to identify 
and remove duplicate entries as well as correct any errors within the dataset.

2. Normality Assessment

To assess the normality of our data distribution. This plot helped us visualize whether the data follows a normal 
distribution or not. Data followed a normal distribution.

3. Statistical hypothesis test

We employed the Student t-test to compare means and the Kolmogorov Smirnov two-sample test to assess the similarity of 
the distributions between the different columns of our dataset, with the aim of investigating their potential 
relationships. 

4. Correlation Analysis

We examined the correlation between T2D (Type 2 Diabetes) and HTN (Hypertension) conditions in the dataset. 
We used the Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the strength of the linear relationship between these two 
variables. We also plotted a scatter plot to visualize the correlation between these two variables.

5. Visualisation

We created plots to visually represent the correlation and observations within our data. 
We aimed to gain insights into the relationships between different variables and any patterns or trends that might be 
present. 

6. Data Mining:

The purpose of defining a list of regular expressions (patterns) in this code is to facilitate the automatic extraction 
of the number of participants used in several studies from a collection of text abstracts. By including various synonyms
for the term 'participants', such as 'subjects', 'patients', 'individuals', and others, the regular expressions are 
intended to match a wide range of possible strings within the text that represent the number of participants in each 
study. By automating this process, the code aims to save time and effort compared to manually reviewing each abstract 
and extracting this information by hand.
