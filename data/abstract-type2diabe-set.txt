BACKGROUND: Hematological abnormalities are linked with diabetes mellitus (DM) 
and play a major role in diabetes-related micro- and macro-vascular 
complications. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the magnitude of 
peripheral cytopenia and associated factors in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from March to May 2021 at the 
University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. A total of 357 T2DM 
participants were selected using a simple random sampling technique. A total of 
3 mL of venous blood samples were collected using the vacutainer method for the 
complete blood count (CBC). A univariate and multivariate regression analysis 
were used to investigate the association between dependent and independent 
variables. P-value ˂0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: The magnitude of cytopenia, bicytopenia, and pancytopenia were 21% (95% 
CI: 17.1, 25.53), 1.1% (95% CI: 0.44, 2.85), and 0.56% (95% CI: 0.01, 1.12), 
respectively. Furthermore, the magnitudes of anemia, leucopenia, and 
thrombocytopenia were 8.7% (95% CI: 6.18, 12.06), 10.9% (95% CI: 8.09, 14.59), 
and 5.3% (95% CI: 3.43, 8.16), respectively. Being male (AOR: 3.23; 95% CI: 
1.43, 7.56), lack of exercise (AOR: 2.70; 95% CI: 1.137, 6.43), and never 
married (AOR: 3.90; 95% CI: 1.248, 12.18) were all associated with anemia.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that T2DM causes disturbances in the hematological 
parameters and leads to a mild level of cytopenia. It is, therefore, suggested 
that hematological abnormalities, especially cytopenia, should be monitored and 
controlled on a regular basis in T2DM patients for better prognosis and quality 
of life.

BACKGROUND: Hypertension among diabetic patients is a worldwide public health 
challenge and a leading modifiable risk factor for other cardiovascular diseases 
and death. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of hypertension among 
diabetic patients in Ethiopia.
METHODS: The studies were selected using PubMed, Embase, Health InterNetwork 
Access to Research Initiative and Cochrane Library databases and Google 
searches. Two independent authors carried out the data extraction using a 
predetermined and structured method of data collection. R version 3.5.3 and 
RStudio version 1.2.5003 were used for analysing the data. To assess possible 
publication bias, funnel plot test methods were used. The guidelines of the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses were used to 
publish the results. This study was registered in the Prospective Register 
Systematic Reviews (CRD42020170649).
RESULTS: A total of 218 articles were identified but only 6 six full-text 
abstract papers were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The 
random effects model analysis showed that the pooled prevalence of hypertension 
among type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients in Ethiopia was 55% (95% confidence 
interval [CI] 49 to 61). The subgroup analysis of the pooled prevalence of 
hypertension among type 2 DM patients in the Oromia and Southern regions was 51% 
(95% CI 42 to 59) and 58% (95% CI 54 to 63), respectively. The pooled prevalence 
of hypertension among type 2 DM patients was higher among urban residents (60% 
[95% CI 54 to 67] and 52% [95% CI 41 to 63] among urban and rural residents, 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a high pooled prevalence of hypertension among 
type 2 DM patients in Ethiopia. Appropriate preventive measures should be 
implemented to reduce the burden of hypertension among DM patients in Ethiopia.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a public health problem in developing as well as 
developed nations. DM leads to many complications that are associated with 
higher morbidity and mortality worldwide. Therefore, the current study was 
planned to assess the prevalence and risk factors of type-2 DM in Ethiopian 
population. Six electronic databases such as: PubMed, Scopus, Hinari, Web of 
science, Google Scholar, and African Journals Online were searched for studies 
published in English up December 30, 2020. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used for 
quality assessment of the included studies. The data was extracted by Microsoft 
excel and analyzed through Stata version 16 software. The random effect 
meta-regression analysis was computed at 95% CI to assess the pooled prevalence 
and risk factors of type-2 DM. Forty observational studies were included in this 
systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of DM in Ethiopia was 
6.5% (95% CI (5.8, 7.3)). The sub-group analysis revealed that the highest 
prevalence of DM was found in Dire Dawa city administration (14%), and the 
lowest prevalence was observed in Tigray region (2%). The pooled prevalence of 
DM was higher (8%) in studies conducted in health facility. Factors like: 
Age ≥ 40 years ((Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 1.91 (95% CI: 1.05, 3.49)), 
Illiterate (AOR: 2.74 (95% CI: 1.18, 6.34)), Cigarette smoking (AOR: 1.97 (95% 
CI: 1.17, 3.32)), Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2 (AOR: 2.01 (95 CI: 1.46, 
2.27)), family history of DM (AOR: 6.14 (95% CI: 2.80, 13.46)), history of 
hypertension (AOR: 3.00 (95% CI: 1.13, 7.95)) and physical inactivity (AOR: 5.79 
(95% CI: 2.12, 15.77)) were significantly associated with type-2 DM in Ethiopian 
population. In this review, the prevalence of type-2 DM was high. Factors like: 
Older age, illiteracy, cigarette smoking, MBI ≥ 25, family history of DM, 
history of hypertension and physical inactivity were an identified risk factors 
of type-2 DM. Therefore, health education and promotion will be warranted. 
Further, large scale prospective studies will be recommended to address possible 
risk factors of type-2 DM in Ethiopian population.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is a serious metabolic disorder which becomes 
common in middle and low incomes countries since few decades. Microvascular 
complications include retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy all of which can 
lead to disability, dependency, accelerate their morbidity, and mortality. In 
Ethiopia, there is paucity data regarding this topic. Hence, this study aimed to 
assess prevalence of microvascular complications and its predictors among type 2 
diabetes mellitus patients.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study was conducted from February to March 2020 at 
Dessie town hospitals. We used simple random sampling to recruit study 
participants and pre-tested interviewer administered questionnaire to collect 
the data. Data was entered into Epi-Data 3.1 and exported to SPSS-23 for 
analysis. Binary logistic regression was done to select potential variables to 
be adjusted at p ≤ 0.25. After running multivariable regression, variables with 
a p-value ≤ 0.05 were declared as statistically significant.
RESULTS: Three hundred and thirty-five type 2 DM patients participated in the 
study, of which 54.6% were males. One hundred and twenty-seven [37.9% (95% CI 
32.5%-43.3%)] of diabetes mellitus had at least one microvascular complications. 
These were retinopathy 24.8%, nephropathy 16.1%, and neuropathy 8.1%. Age 
60-87 years (AOR = 2.76, 95% CI 1.02-7.46), duration of diabetes > 5 years 
(AOR = 4.09, 95% CI 2.40-6.96), mellitus and co-morbid hypertension (AOR = 3.52, 
95% CI 2.09-5.95), were statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, diabetic microvascular complications are prevalent. 
Increasing the age of participants, longer duration of diabetes mellitus and 
co-morbid hypertension were independent predictors. Health workers should give 
emphasis for diabetes mellitus through early screening and health education, 
abrupt medication for aged patients with long duration of diabetes mellitus, and 
hypertension, and also early detection and management of microvascular 
complication.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the level and correlates of self-care 
practices among patients with type 2 diabetes on follow-up in two public 
hospitals in Harar, Eastern Ethiopia.
METHODS: We conducted a hospital-based cross-sectional study on adult patients 
with type 2 diabetes, surveying diabetes self-care practices using a 15-item 
Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities. Responses ranged from 0 to 7 days, and 
a composite score was computed representing the mean days of diabetes self-care 
practices. A generalized Poisson regression model with robust variance was used. 
The association between the diabetes self-care practices and correlates was 
examined using the incidence rate ratio with a 95% confidence level. The 
statistical significance was set at a p value of ⩽0.05.
RESULTS: This study included 879 patients with type 2 diabetes. The overall mean 
(standard deviation) diabetes self-care practices were 3.7 ± 1.1 days out of the 
recommended 7 days, indicating low self-care practices. After controlling for 
other variables, tertiary educational level (incidence rate ratio = 1.06; 95% 
confidence interval: 1.01, 1.12), adequate diabetes knowledge (incidence rate 
ratio = 1.04; 95% confidence interval: 1.00, 1.08), moderate (incidence rate 
ratio = 1.07; 95% confidence interval: 1.02, 1.11) and high perceived 
self-efficacy (incidence rate ratio = 1.14; 95% confidence interval: 1.09, 1.13) 
(incidence rate ratio = 1.07; 95% confidence interval: 1.02, 1.11), high to 
marginal food security (incidence rate ratio = 1.13; 95% confidence interval: 
1.03, 1.24), and receiving dietary advice (incidence rate ratio = 1.11; 95% 
confidence interval: 0.06, 1.15) were positively correlated with diabetes 
self-care practices. A history of hospitalization, on the other hand, was found 
to be inversely correlated with diabetes self-care practices (incidence rate 
ratio = 0.94; 95% confidence interval: 0.88, 0.99).
CONCLUSION: The study indicated that adherence of patients with type 2 diabetes 
to the recommended self-care practices was considerably low. Therefore, tailored 
diabetes self-management education to enhance self-efficacy and diabetes 
self-care practices must be in place. This can be achieved through the system or 
individual-based integrated intervention efforts.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This study aimed to examine perspectives of patients, 
health professionals, and policymakers on current practices and their future 
preferences for type 2 diabetes care in a tertiary hospital in Ethiopia.
METHODS: An exploratory qualitative study was undertaken through interviews and 
focus groups with patients, health professionals, and policymakers. The 
participants were purposively sampled. Thematic analysis was undertaken.
RESULTS: Fifty-nine participants were involved in the study. Participants' 
perspectives on current practices and future preferences comprised three themes: 
organisation of type 2 diabetes care delivery and infrastructure; continuity of 
care; and structured diabetes education. The current organisation comprised 
physicians, such as endocrinologists and endocrinology fellows, and nurses. Some 
nurses received training on diabetes foot and diabetic eye, which enabled 
patients to receive diabetes foot and diabetic eye care, respectively. The 
hospital lacked essential resources, such as medications, laboratory and 
diagnostic services, and diabetes educators, which hindered patient-centred 
care. Patients complained that the physical set-up at the hospital was not 
conducive to their privacy during consultations. Participants reported 
infrequent patient follow-up and monitoring, which contributed to uncontrolled 
diabetes. Future preferences involved access to essential resources and 
comprehensive diabetes care, such as structured diabetes education for improved 
patient outcomes. Participants sought out the development of tailored and 
context-specific diabetes management approaches that could meet specific patient 
needs and preferences.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings have implications for designing patient-centred 
diabetes care tailored to the hospital's context and key stakeholders' 
preferences. This tailoring requires strong leadership to ensure availability of 
essential resources.

OBJECTIVES: This study tried to assess the level of dietary knowledge and 
practice and associated factors among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in 
public hospitals of Dire Dawa, Ethiopia.
METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 253 type 2 
diabetes mellitus patients visiting follow-up clinic in public hospitals 
selected by systematic random sampling. Primary data were collected by 
face-to-face interview and checklist. The collected data were entered into SPSS 
version 22 and analyzed using proportion, percentage, and mean and standard 
deviation. Bivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify candidate 
variables affecting dietary practice. Finally, all candidate independent 
variables were further adjusted on multivariate regression analysis with 
adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval to identify factors 
independently associated with dietary practice. p-value ⩽0.05 declared as level 
of significance.
RESULTS: The level of poor dietary practice among type 2 diabetes mellitus 
patients was found to be 53.8%. Around 78.8% of participants had fasting blood 
sugar level ⩾130 mg/dL, and 52.8% found to have poor dietary knowledge. 
Moreover, there was no up-to-date nutritional guideline in follow-up clinic. Not 
getting nutrition advice from doctors/nurses, low duration of follow-up, lack of 
family support, and despondency were significantly associated with poor dietary 
practice (p-value < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: More than half of diabetes patients had poor dietary practice, which 
is in contrary with international recommendations of diabetic self-care. Habit 
of eating fruits and vegetables was poorly practiced and also patients' 
knowledge of recommended nutrition was poor. Therefore, provision of robust 
nutritional education and counseling service, a system to strengthen family 
support as well as psychosocial support, is highly recommended.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) has become a global health challenge. 
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the common comorbidities of T2D 
that may affect the ability to perform diabetes self-care.
PURPOSE: To compare self-care practices between adult T2D patients with and 
without comorbid DPN and identify factors predicting self-care practices.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, conducted at tertiary hospitals in 
Ethiopia, a total of 216 (108 with DNP and 108 without DNP) participants 
completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire including measures of 
diabetes self-care practices, self-evaluated peripheral neuropathy, 
self-efficacy, diabetes knowledge, and social support.
RESULTS: Adult T2D patients with comorbid DPN had lower dietary (P< 0.001), 
exercise (P< 0.001), blood glucose testing (P = 0.001), and foot (P = 0.007) 
self-care practice than those without DPN. Social support is a significant 
predictor of dietary self-care in both groups while predicting foot self-care 
and blood glucose testing in those with comorbid DPN. Moreover, occupation, 
education, and having a glucometer are significant predictors of diabetes 
self-care practice in both groups.
CONCLUSION: This study found that adult T2D patients with comorbid DPN have 
poorer diabetes self-care practice than those without comorbid DPN. 
Interventions should focus on addressing social support and access to a 
glucometer in order to improve diabetes self-care practices in adult T2D 
patients with comorbid DPN.

BACKGROUND: Microvascular complications lead to disability, dependency, and 
accelerated morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to identify predictors of 
blood glucose change and time to microvascular complications among patients with 
type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among type 2 diabetes 
mellitus patients enrolled between December 2014 and December 2015 at Felege 
Hiwot and Debre Markos Referral Hospital. A total of 318 T2DM patients were 
included in the study. Joint modelling of longitudinal and survival analysis was 
employed to identify predictors of Blood Glucose Change and Microvascular 
Complications in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients.
RESULTS: The prevalence of microvascular complications in Type 2 diabetes 
patients was 26.3%, 95%confidence interval(CI):(21.5, 31.1). Of which, half of 
the patients developed a microvascular complication after 30 months from the 
onset of the follow-up. The significant predictors of developing microvascular 
complication were positive proteinurea (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 1.418, 
95%CI: 1.080, 1.861), Serum creatinine (AHR = 3.704, 95%CI: 1.992, 6.887), 
Weight (AHR = 1.058, 95%CI: 1.023, 1.094), and log fasting blood 
glucose(log(FBS))(AHR = 1.013, 95%CI: 1.010, 1.015). The predictors of fasting 
blood glucose progression were higher baseline 
FBS(est(estimate) = 0.002,95%CI:0.0018, 0.0022), Systolic blood pressure (SBP) 
(est = 0.003, 95%CI: 0.002, 0.004), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (est = 0.002, 
95%CI: 0.0002, 0.004), and age (est = 0.003, 95%CI: 0.001, 0.004).
CONCLUSION: The progression of the fasting blood glucose level for rural 
patients was faster than for urban patients. Patients having higher baseline 
FBS, previous hypertension history, higher SBP, higher DBP, older age, and fewer 
visits to the hospital have a relatively more progressive change in blood sugar 
levels. Patients having higher triglyceride levels, positive proteinuria, higher 
fasting blood sugar, higher weight, and a lesser number of hospital visits have 
a higher risk of developing a complication. In response to this finding, an 
aggressive intervention that targets to prevent microvascular complications is 
required.

INTRODUCTION: Diabetes self-care is important to maintain optimal glycemic 
control and prevent debilitating and costly complications. Diabetes self-care 
may be improved through the identification of individual and group barriers to 
regimen adherence and subsequent development of specific plans to overcome these 
barriers. This study assessed the self-care practice and associated factors 
among type 2 diabetes patients attending their treatment at Dessie Referral 
Hospital, Dessie, North-Eastern Ethiopia.
METHODS: The study employed parallel mixed methods design which followed a 
cross-sectional interview and in-depth interview methods, respectively, from 
September to October 2019. The collected data were subjected to descriptive and 
inferential analysis for the quantitative part and a thematic analysis for the 
qualitative part.
RESULTS: A total of 328 type 2 diabetes patients participated in the study of 
which 50.3% reported good self-care practice. Being in the age category of 60-69 
years old (AOR = 0.334, 95% CI (0.135, 0.951)), being ≥70 years old (AOR = 
0.359, 95% CI (0.135, 0.951)), having complications (AOR = 1.956, 95% CI (1.172, 
3.262)), having co-morbidity (AOR = 0.443, 95% CI (0.262, 0.749)) and diabetes 
education (AOR = 2.684, 95% CI (1.633, 4.412)) were significantly associated 
with good diabetes self-care. Accessibility, social support, knowledge and 
beliefs and diabetes-related morbidities were identified as barriers to diabetes 
self-care by the patients.
CONCLUSION: The findings from this study revealed that only half of the type 2 
diabetes patients who participated in this study reported good self-care 
practice. Different factors, including diabetes education, were significantly 
associated with good diabetes self-care according to the quantitative study. 
This was supported by the findings from the qualitative part and thus the 
recommendation to strengthen diabetes health education to patients and their 
families.

BACKGROUND: One of the chronic diseases, all over the world, due to its 
significant contribution to the existence of other health problems is 
hypertension. It is known that hypertensive patients exposed to diabetes and the 
reverse is also true. The objective of the current investigation was to identify 
joint risk factors for hypertension and type 2 diabetes for adults under 
treatment.
METHODS: A random sample of 748 hypertensive and type 2 diabetic patients was 
selected. A retrospective longitudinal study was conducted with the selected 
patients who were receiving treatment for both hypertension and type 2 diabetes. 
A joint linear mixed-effect model was used for data analysis in this 
investigation.
RESULTS: The current investigation revealed that age (β = 0.18, p-value = 0.04 
for hypertension, β = 0.81, p-value = 0.02 for type 2 diabetes) and weight of 
patients (β = 0.52, p-value <0.01 for hypertension, β = 0.32, p-value <0.01 for 
type 2 diabetes) were positively and significantly associated with existence of 
hypertension and type 2 diabetes whereas visiting times (β = -0.08, p-value = 
0.04 for hypertension, β = -0.38, p-value = 0.03 for type 2 diabetes) were 
negatively associated with the variables of interest. Similarly, patients who do 
not exercise, who smoke, and drink and patients with a family history of disease 
were positively associated with the existence of the variables of interest.
CONCLUSION: Hypertension and diabetes are highly correlated and one is the 
causes of the other. Hypertensive and diabetic patients should be aware that 
they should stop drinking alcohol and smoking and should attend properly to 
their medication as prescribed by health staff. They should also be advised to 
undertake physical exercise to reduce risks related to these two correlated 
diseases.

BACKGROUND: Even though adherence to dietary counselling for patients with 
diabetes is essential for improving health and preventing complications, access 
to an adequate and quality diet is challenging for patients living in a 
food-insecure household. The availability of data in this regard is limited in 
Ethiopia. Thus, this study assessed the food security status of patients with 
type 2 diabetes, their adherence to dietary counselling, and contributing 
factors at public hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
METHODS: This was a facility-based cross-sectional study among 602 patients with 
Type 2 diabetes in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from July to August 2019. Patients 
were selected randomly after the total number of samples was proportionally 
allocated to four public hospitals. Relevant information was collected by 
trained data collectors using a pre-tested questionnaire. Data were entered into 
Epi-info version 7 and exported to SPSS version 24 for data analysis. Logistic 
regression analysis was employed to identify factors associated with adherence 
to dietary counselling.
RESULT: The proportion of nonadherence to dietary counselling among patients 
with type 2 diabetes was 67.3% (95%CI: 63.5%-71.1%). Nearly half (50.7%) of the 
respondents were food insecure. Of these, mildly food insecure, moderately food 
insecure, and severely food insecure were 8.5%, 29.2%, and 13%, respectively. 
Physical activity (AOR = 1.7; 95%CI: 1.1-2.9); diabetes knowledge (AOR = 1.8; 
95%CI: 1.2-2.6); lack of access to information (AOR = 1.6; 95%CI: 1.1-2.6); 
moderately food insecure (AOR = 2.2; 95%CI: 1.3-3.7); and severely food insecure 
(AOR = 5.6; 95%CI: 2.1-15.0) were the major significant factors associated with 
nonadherence to dietary counselling.
CONCLUSION: Over two-thirds of patients with diabetes did not adhere to dietary 
counselling, which appears high. As a result, improving diabetes education, 
information access, and food security status should be considered to ensure 
dietary counselling adherence among type 2 diabetes patients.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes, together with its complications, has a considerable 
negative influence on people's quality of life and healthcare delivery and 
raises diabetic mortality. However, there is limited information about the 
diabetes-associated chronic complications in the study setting. Therefore, this 
study aimed to determine the burden and factors related to the chronic 
complications among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Eastern Ethiopia.
METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 879 patients 
with T2D at two public hospitals in Harar. The data were collected through 
interviews using a structured questionnaire. Data related to the diagnosis of 
chronic complications and biochemical tests were extracted from medical records. 
The outcome variable was the number of chronic complications that happened to 
the patients. A generalized Poisson regression model with robust variance 
estimation was used to investigate the association of independent variables with 
chronic complications. An adjusted prevalence ratio with a 95% CI was reported 
to show an association using a p-value ≤0.05.
RESULTS: One or more chronic complications were presented in 43% of T2D (95% CI: 
39.65, 46.19). Macrovascular and microvascular complications were found in 27.6% 
and 23.5% of patients, respectively. Urban residence (APR = 2.64; 95% CI: 1.54, 
4.54), low wealth status (APR = 1.80; 95% CI: 1.17, 2.76), diabetes duration ≥5 
years (APR = 1.46; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.01), hypertriglyceridemia (APR = 1.48; 95% 
CI: 1.07, 2.09) and poor self-care practices (APR = 1.62; 95% CI: 1.18, 2.23) 
were factors significantly associated with the chronic complications.
CONCLUSION: The burden of chronic complications was high, with nearly half of 
T2D patients experiencing one or more chronic complications. Almost one in ten 
patients suffered from multiple chronic complications. The complications were 
mainly influenced by being urban resident, low wealth status, and poor self-care 
practices. Therefore, health care providers need to educate patients and promote 
self-care practices and healthy lifestyles to achieve treatment goals and lower 
the risk of chronic complications.

BACKGROUND: Visual impairment is a functional limitation of the eye(s) that 
results in reduced visual acuity, visual field loss, visual distortion, 
perceptual difficulties, or any combination of the above. Type 2 diabetes 
mellitus is one of the common causes of visual impairment. Since there is no 
study conducted in Ethiopia so far in this regard, the current study aimed to 
determine the prevalence and predictors of visual impairment among people living 
with diabetes at Dessie town Hospitals, Northeast Ethiopia.
METHODS: Institution based cross-sectional study was carried out from 15 
February to 15 March 2020 using simple random sampling to recruit study 
participants among type 2 diabetes. Visual impairment was measured using visual 
acuity test. We used Epi Data 3.1 and SPSS version 22 for data entry and 
statistical analysis, respectively. Bi-variable binary logistic regression was 
performed to check independent association of each factor with visual 
impairment. After selecting candidate variables at p < 0.25, we computed 
multivariable binary logistic regression to identify statistically associated 
factors of visual impairment. The degree of association was determined using 
adjusted odds ratio with 95%CI. In the final model, statistical significance was 
declared at p < 0.05.
RESULTS: Three hundred and twenty-two people living with T2DM participated in 
this study with 97% response rate. The prevalence of visual impairment was 
37.58% (95% CI: 32.3, 42.9). Age (AOR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.09, p < 
or = 0.001), poor regular exercise (AOR = 2.91, 95%CI: 1.47-5.76, p < 
or = 0.001), duration of DM above 5 years (AOR = 2.42, 95% CI: 1.25-4.73, p < 
or = 0.01), insulin treatment (AOR = 14.05, 95% CI: 2.72, 72.35, p < or = 0.01), 
and poor glycemic control (AOR = 2.17, 95% CI: 1.13-4.14, p < 0.05) were 
statistically associated with visual impairment.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of visual impairment in Dessie town hospitals 
accounted for more than a third of patients living with T2DM. Visual impairment 
is associated with increased age, poor regular exercise, longer duration of DM, 
and insulin treatment. Thus, early detection of VI through screening and regular 
follow-up is recommended to reduce the risk of VI and vision loss.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of diabetes and its associated complications rising 
in Ethiopia ranged from 2.0%-6.5%, the primary cause of morbidity and mortality 
with consequential economic impact. This study aimed to assess the prevalence 
and risk factors of dyslipidemia among diabetes follow-up patients.
METHODS: Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted at Debre Berhan 
Referral Hospital from January to March 2020 in 347 Adult type 2 diabetes 
follow-up patients using a convenient sampling technique. Data were collected by 
interviews and entered using Epi-data 4.2 and analyzed using SPSS version 25. 
Factors having a p-value < 0.25 in the bi-variable logistic regression model 
were entered into a multivariable logistic regression model. Statistical 
Significance was declared at a p-value ≤ of 0.05.
RESULTS: The prevalence of dyslipidemia among type 2 diabetes patients in this 
study was 59 %. Significantly associated variables were being female [AOR 2.6 
(95% CI 1.2-3.2), P = 0.011], smoking history [AOR 4.1 (95% CI 2-6.8), P = 
0.001], Being overweight [AOR 3.5 (95% CI 1.6-7.8), P = 0.002], Being obese [AOR 
4.8 (95% CI 1.7-13), P = 0.002].
CONCLUSION: Prevalence of dyslipidemia was high among diabetic patients, which 
accounts for 59%. Being female, smoking history, being overweight, and being 
obese were determinants of dyslipidemia. Patients with poor glycemic control 
need additional lipid-lowering therapies to prevent secondary Atherosclerotic 
vascular complications.

Treated at Adama General Hospital, Oromia, Ethiopia: A Comparison of Cox-PH and 
Shared Lognormal Frailty Models.

BACKGROUND: Recovery from type 2 diabetes is frequently recurrent, as a single 
patient may recover from more than one over time. The goal of this study was to 
know the recurrent event (time to recovery) and associated factors of type 2 
diabetes in Adama General Hospital, Ethiopia, by comparing shared lognormal 
frailty and Cox-PH models.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 302 type 2 diabetic patients (01, 2011-01, 
and 2016) was considered. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the 
study variables. The standard Cox-proportional hazards model and a shared 
lognormal frailty model have been compared. The latter model with a 95% 
significance level was fitted, variables with P value < 0.05 were considered 
significant, and the adjusted hazard ratio has been used to measure the strength 
of the risk.
RESULTS: About 56.6% of the patients recovered. The average recovery time was 
33.53 (standard deviation, 20.404 ) weeks. Gender (adjusted HR = 1.168, 95% CI = 
(0.93, 1.46), P < 0.05), family history (adjusted HR = 0.765, 95% CI = (0.59, 
0.99), P < 0.05), cholesterol level (adjusted HR = 0.738, 95% CI = (0.57, 0.96), 
P < 0.05), alcohol use (adjusted HR = 0.698, 95% CI = (0.53, 0.92), P < 0.05), 
and smoking cigarette (adjusted HR = 0.674, 95% CI = (0.51, 0.89), P < 0.05) 
were statistically significant. The estimated frailty term's variance was 0.426 
(P value=0.028). Also, the author presents a comparison study for the same data 
by using a model selection criterion and suggests a better model (shared 
lognormal frailty model).
CONCLUSION: Finally, the median recovery time was 30 weeks. Female patients had 
a better chance of recovery than male patients. A shared lognormal frailty model 
outperformed the Cox-PH model in fitting the data and controlling event 
interdependence. There was risk heterogeneity among patients. Positive family 
history, high cholesterol level, alcohol use, and smoking have an inverse 
relationship with the overall likelihood of the patients' recovery time. 
Therefore, future improvement measures against type 2 DM recovery should take 
all events (for example, the first, second, and third recovery in this study) 
and these identified factors into account.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of conducting this study was to assess fatty liver 
disease and its correlation with glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus 
patients. In addition, evaluation of associated factors and correlation analysis 
between the fatty liver index and hemoglobin A1C level in patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus was another aim of this study.
METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among type 2 
diabetes mellitus patients attending at diabetes clinic of Dessie Comprehensive 
Specialized Hospital located in south Wollo, Ethiopia. It was conducted from 
July to August 2021. The fatty liver index was calculated to assess fatty liver 
disease. Simple descriptive statistics, multivariate analysis, and an 
independent sample t-test were utilized for statistical analysis. Multiple 
logistic regression analysis was used to determine the associated factors of 
fatty liver. The p value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
RESULTS: In this study, the mean ± standard deviation values of body mass index 
among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients were 25.82 ± 3.64, 28.04 ± 2.43, and 
22.70 ± 2.62 in both fatty and non-fatty liver cases, respectively. In this 
study, the prevalence of fatty liver among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients was 
58.4%. There was a significant positive correlation between the level of 
Hemoglobin A1C or glycated hemoglobin and fatty liver index (p value = 0.008, 
r = 0.35). The development of fatty liver was 4.6 times more likely among 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had insufficient physical exercise 
than sufficient exercise. Patients with insulin and oral hypoglycemic drugs were 
0.8 folds less likely to have a fatty liver as compared to oral hypoglycemic 
drug treatment.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that the prevalence of 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was elevated among patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus who had higher levels of body mass index, waist circumference, 
triglycerides, glycated hemoglobin, and gamma-glutamyltransferase. Therefore, 
glycemic control, sufficient physical exercise, and insulin treatment may reduce 
the risk of fatty liver disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea is a syndrome characterized by recurrent 
partial, or complete upper airway collapse during sleep. Although obstructive 
sleep apnea is common in type 2 diabetes mellitus, the majority of patients 
remain undiagnosed because of the prohibitive cost of the test and paucity of 
the sleep clinic, especially in developing nations. The study aimed to assess 
high-risk obstructive sleep apnea and its associated factors among type 2 
diabetes mellitus patients at Wolkite University Specialized Hospital.
METHODS: A Hospital-based comparative cross-sectional study was employed from 
October 15 to December 5, 2021, among 204 participants. Data collection was done 
by semi-structured interviewer-administered questionnaires. Data was entered 
into the Epi data version 4.6 and exported to SPSS version 25.0 for analysis. 
Independent t-test and chi-square test were used to compare continuous and 
categorical variables accordingly. Binary and multiple logistic regression 
analysis was used to assess factors associated with high-risk obstructive sleep 
apnea. Statistical significance was set at P-value < 0.05.
RESULTS: A total of 204 participants with an equal proportion of the two groups 
were included with a 100% response rate. About 56.9% of the participants were 
males. The mean age of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients was 57.1 (± 12.0) years 
and the non-diabetic group was 55.3 (± 10.9) years. The prevalence of high-risk 
obstructive sleep apnea among type 2 diabetes mellitus was 42.2%, and that of 
non-diabetics was 13.7% (p < 0.001). Age (AOR: 1.13; 95%CI: 1.04, 1.22), neck 
grasp (AOR: 6.48; 95%CI: 1.56, 26.96), waist circumference (AOR: 4.44; 95%CI: 
1.12, 17.61) and the presence of diabetes-related complications (AOR: 4.18; 
95%CI: 1.13, 15.43) were independently associated with high-risk obstructive 
sleep apnea among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of high-risk obstructive sleep apnea among type 2 
diabetes mellitus was higher with a significant difference from their comparison 
group. Age, neck grasp, waist circumference, and diabetes-related complications 
were significantly associated with high-risk obstructive sleep apnea among type 
2 diabetes mellitus patients. Therefore, type 2 diabetes mellitus patients 
should be screened for obstructive sleep apnea in the early course of their 
follow-up to take preventive measures and early treatments.

INTRODUCTION: good dietary practice is one of the top pillars of self-care among 
patients of diabetes mellitus. However, the dietary practice of patients 
attending health institutions in the study area was not studied. Therefore, the 
prevalence and associated factors of poor dietary practice were determined among 
diabetic patients on follow-up in Nigist Eleni Mohammed Memorial Referral and 
Teaching Hospital, Southern Ethiopia.
METHODS: facility-based cross-sectional study design was employed on type-2 
diabetes mellitus adult patients. The study was conducted from March to April 
2020. Total sample size was 322. Systematic random sampling method was used to 
select the study respondents. Odds ratio and their 95% confidence intervals 
together with P-value ≤0.05 were used to identify independent predictors of poor 
dietary practice during multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: the prevalence of the poor dietary practice among type diabetes 
patients was 53.7% (n=168). Low wealth status AOR 3.34, 95% CI: 1.50-7.41; 
p-value=0.003 and absence of family and friends support AOR 4.80, 95% CI: 
2.54-9.0 and P-value<0.001 were associated factors with poor dietary practice 
among type-2 diabetes patients.
CONCLUSION: the overall prevalence of poor dietary practice among type-2 
diabetic adult patients was high that not going in line with international 
recommendations on dietary management of the diabetes mellitus. Integrated 
governmental and non-governmental activities should be in place to improve the 
economic status of type-2 diabetic patients. Support from the family members is 
found to be essential factor to promote dietary practice among type-2 diabetic 
adult patients.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is becoming highly prevalent worldwide and it is one 
of the leading causes of mortality. The cause of mortality among these patients 
is mostly related to the dominant presence of modifiable cardiovascular risk 
factors such as obesity. The aim of the current study is therefore to determine 
the prevalence of obesity and its associated factors among patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus at Sidama region, Ethiopia.
METHOD: Institution-based cross-sectional study design was implemented to 
determine the prevalence of obesity and its associated factor among patients 
with type two diabetes at Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital 
and Yirgalem General Hospital from October 16 2018 to December 21, 2018. A 
simple random sampling technique was implemented to select 314 study 
participants. After obtaining consent, different patients' related data were 
collected using a questionnaire. Patients' records were also reviewed. 4ml of 
the blood sample was collected from each study participant and analyzed for 
lipid profile test. Blood glucose level was done using COBAS INTEGRA 6000. A 
binary logistic regression was used to assess factors that have an association 
with obesity. A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULT: The majority of the study participants (67.2%) were male and 61.8% of 
the study participants were aged >45years. The overall prevalence of overweight 
and obesity among the study participants was 36.3% and 18.8% respectively. About 
41% of the study participants have a normal BMI. Females were more obese (28.2% 
Vs 14.2%) than males and BMI stratification by sex was statistically significant 
(P = 0.02). Sex (AOR = 3.0, CI = 1.6-5.7, P-Value = 0.001) and TG (AOR = 3.6, CI 
= 1.6-8.3, P-Value = 0.003) are factors that were independently associated with 
obesity among type 2 DM patients.
CONCLUSION: Overweight and obesity among type two diabetic patients were 
prevalent. In addition, obesity and overweight disorder are common among T2DM 
and gender and triglycerides levels were associated with obesity.

BACKGROUND: Self-care practice is the mainstay of management for good glycemic 
control. Despite the presence of a few pocket studies, no comprehensive study 
was conducted in Ethiopia to demonstrate the overall good self-care practice 
among diabetic patients in Ethiopia. Therefore, we intended to conduct this 
systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the overall good self-care 
practice among people living with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Ethiopia.
METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Cochrane 
library, Google scholar, and direct Google to retrieve relevant studies. Forest 
plot was used to present the pooled estimate of good self-care practice using 
DerSimonian and Laird's random-effects model. We checked publication bias using 
Egger's test and funnel plot. Potential heterogeneity was tested using the 
I-squared statistic. Moreover, subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: In this review, 12 primary studies (with a total sample size of 4030) 
were included. Because of the presence of heterogeneity, we employed a 
random-effects model. After running the random-effects model, the pooled 
estimate of overall good self-care practice was 51.12% (95% CI: 41.90-60.34). 
Furthermore, the pooled estimate of good dietary practice was 50.18% (95% CI: 
32.75-67.60), good physical exercise practice was 48.29% (95% CI: 34.14-62.43), 
the good footcare practice was 63.61% (95% CI: 45.56-81.66), and appropriate 
self-monitoring of the blood glucose level was 31.89% (95% CI: -4.62-68.41). In 
this meta-analysis, there was serious interstudy variation, but there was no 
publication bias.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall good self-care practice among people living with T2DM 
was low which necessitates the need for designing strategies to increase the 
self-care practice. The health sector has to bolster awareness creation to allow 
better plasma glucose control and preventing diabetes-related complications. 
This trial is registered with CRD42019147694.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to explore the level of glycemic 
control and its determinants among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at 
Menelik II Referral Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study design was employed. The sample size was 
determined using a single proportion formula and 245 patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus were involved in this study. Systematic sampling method was 
used to select the study subjects. Standard questionnaire was used to collect 
patient's biographic data, economic data, self-care activities, and patient 
compliance to medications. Summary statistics of a given data were calculated. 
Logistic regression model was used to measure the relationship between the 
outcome and predictor variable. Direction and strength of association was 
expressed using odds ratio and 95% confidence interval.
RESULT: More than three-fourth, 191 (80.3%) of diabetic patients had poor 
glycemic control. Poor glycemic control was found to be 7.03 times higher among 
diabetic patients with duration of 5-10 years (adjusted odds ratio = 7.03, 95% 
confidence interval = 2.7-18.6). Similarly, diabetic patients with a duration of 
above 10 years were poorly controlled their blood sugar level (adjusted odds 
ratio = 2.3, 95% confidence interval = 1.028-5.08) in comparison to diabetic 
patients with a duration of fewer than 5 years. It was also found that 
compliance with a specific diet was significantly associated with good control 
of blood sugar level (adjusted odds ratio = 3.7, 95% confidence interval = 
1.24-11.13).
CONCLUSION: The magnitude of patients with poor glycemic control was high. 
Duration of diabetes and non-compliance with diets high in fruits, vegetables, 
and diets low in fat and sugar were significantly related to uncontrolled blood 
glucose levels. Therefore, developing strategies targeted toward improving blood 
glucose control with special attention to diabetes mellitus (DM) patients with a 
duration of ⩾5 years and those who poorly comply with their diet was strongly 
recommended.

BACKGROUND: The goals of glycemic management for patients with diabetes are to 
prevent or delay complications and optimize quality of life. However, in 
clinical practice, the recommended glycemic control target is difficult to 
achieve. Therefore, it is important to identify factors that influence the 
outcomes of glycemia to improve the quality of diabetic management. The study 
aimed to evaluate the level and factors associated with glycemic control among 
type 2 diabetic outpatients at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, 
Ethiopia.
METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 
systematically selected 325 patients with type 2 diabetes who attended diabetic 
clinics at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital. Pretested, structured, and 
interviewer-administered questionnaires were used to collect sociodemographic 
and diabetes-related information from March 1 to May 30, 2021. HbA1c was used to 
assess glycemic control according to the HbA1c target of < 7% ('good' control) 
as recommended by the American Diabetes Association for non-pregnant adults. The 
HbA1c level in the range of 7-8% was defined as 'inadequate' control and 'poor' 
at levels > 8%. Data entry and analysis were performed using SPSS v26. 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify determinants of 
glycemic control.
RESULTS: The median level of HbA1c of the participants was 8.4% (IQR 6.8-10.1). 
And approximately three-quarters (73.8%) of the patients had inadequate and poor 
glycemic control (HbA1c ≥ 7%). Older age (AOR: 2.46, 95% CI: 1.28-6.01), DM 
duration of > 10 years (AOR: 3.15, 95% CI: 2.22-6.54), insulin therapy (AOR: 
3.07, 95% CI: 2.10-6.12), poor diet compliance (AOR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.28-3.52) 
and failure to set goals for glycemic control (AOR: 3.42, 95% CI: 2.17-5.97) 
were factors associated with inadequate and poor glycemic control.
CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that a significant number of diabetic patients 
had inadequate and poor glycemic control levels. And this was associated with 
older age, longer duration of DM, insulin therapy, poor diet compliance, and 
failure to set control goals. This requires a focus on the associated factors 
identified and tailored management mechanisms to maintain good glycemic control.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the health-related quality of 
life of patients with T2DM and hypertension attending public health facilities 
in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from 1st through 30th August 2020 
at the selected institutions. Health facilities were chosen purposively based on 
patient load. Participants were drawn after proportional to size allocation. A 
translated EQ-5D-3L, and EQ-VAS instrument was used to collect the data. 
Analysis was done using SPSS v.26.0. Both parametric and non-parametric models 
were applied in the analysis.
RESULTS: Of the 409 participants included, the majority were in the age group of 
46-60 (36.0%), females (56.0%), from hospitals (54.8%), jobless (25.4%), and 
married (63.3%). Over two-thirds of the patients reported no problems with 
self-care, usual activity, and depression/anxiety. All dimensions showed an 
increasing proportion of moderate to severe problems in the age group beyond 45. 
Facility type, comorbid condition and age showed a statistically significant 
score difference for QoL. The overall prevalence of any problem was 59.0%. 
Education level, visit to a health center, and marriage showed lower odds of 
affected HRQoL whereas, lower monthly income and presence of comorbidities were 
opposite.
CONCLUSION: HRQoL of patients in the study settings was suboptimal and below the 
general population. Attributes, such as education, facility type, marital 
status, income level, and comorbid status have a statistically significant 
association with HRQoL. Arrangement of a safe and quality health services is 
paramount, especially, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

BACKGROUND: A patient's knowledge, attitude and practice toward diabetes 
self-care is found to be imperative for them to attain the desired treatment 
targets and contribute meaningfully in the management of their disease.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the knowledge, attitude and practice towards diabetes 
self-care with the associated factors among patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) in Jimma Medical Center, Ethiopia.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine knowledge, attitude, 
and practice toward diabetes self-care. Three hundred and seventy-one T2DM 
patients attending Jimma Medical Center from March 30 to June 1, 2019 were 
included in this study and an interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to 
collect the data. SPSS version 20 was used for descriptive and logistic 
regression analysis. Odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals together 
with p-value <0.05 were used to declare statistical significance.
RESULTS: Out of 371 patients, 201 (54.2%) were male. Of the total, 235 (63.3%) 
had good knowledge, 221 (59.6%) had positive attitude, and 201 (54.2%) had good 
self-care practice toward diabetes. Primary educational level (AOR=1.895) was 
associated with poor knowledge of diabetes, while urban living (AOR=0.570) was 
protective for low knowledge of diabetes. Monthly income <1000 Ethiopian birr 
(ETB); (AOR=2.723) and 1000-3000 ETB; (AOR=1.126), illiterate (AOR=2.3), and 
duration of diabetes mellitus (DM) <5 years (AOR=2.242) were significantly 
associated with negative attitude. Having other comorbidities (AOR=0.602) was 
less likely to have negative attitude towards diabetes. Patients age, 41-50 
years (AOR=2.256), and 51-60 years (AOR=2.677), education: being illiterate 
(AOR=4.372), primary level (AOR=4.514), and earning monthly income <1000 ETB 
(AOR=4.229) were significantly associated with poor self-care practice. On the 
contrary, being male (AOR=0.198) was less likely to have a poor self-care 
practice.
CONCLUSION: The knowledge level, attitude status and self-care practice among 
T2DM patients were found to be optimal.

INTRODUCTION: Diabetes related distress is the most common psychological 
co-morbid condition among type 2 diabetes patients. However, although the number 
of people living with diabetes has continued to increase over the last 10 years, 
information regarding diabetes related distress is limited in Ethiopia.
OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of diabetes related 
distress and associated factors among type 2 diabetes patients attending 
hospitals in Southwest Ethiopia.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was employed on 360 type 2 diabetes patients 
attending hospitals from January 1 to March 30, 2020. Convenient sampling 
technique was used to select study participants. Data were entered into EpiData 
manager version 4.2.2 and exported to Statistical Package for the Social 
Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0 and analyzed using descriptive statistics, 
bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions. The statistical significance 
was set at P < 0.05.
RESULTS: Out of a total 360 patients recruited, 321 (89.2%) patients (201 male 
and 120 female) were involved in the study. The mean age of the participants was 
41.3 (SD = 12.8) years. The prevalence of diabetes related distress was 118 
(36.8%) in which emotional distress was the most prevalent (43.6%) domain. Level 
of education [AOR 4.55; 95% CI: 1.28-16.19], family or social support [AOR 0.62; 
95% CI: 0.33-1.06], duration of diabetes [AOR 0.75; 95% CI: 0.35-1.55], having 
diabetes complications [AOR 1.98; 95% CI: 1.0-3.86], smoking status [AOR 1.6; 
95% CI: 1.12-2.97] and alcohol consumption status [AOR 1.4; 95% CI: 1.07-2.53] 
were the identified factors of diabetes related distress.
CONCLUSION: Diabetes related distress was highly prevalent in type 2 diabetes 
patients. Healthcare providers need to address this through integrating 
psychosocial care with collaborative medical care.

BACKGROUND: The original 46-item diabetes quality of life (DQOL) scale has been 
translated into different languages, and the translated DQOL has shown good 
reliability and validity after deleting some items. The aim of this study was to 
translate the diabetes quality of life (DQOL) scale into Afaan Oromoo and to 
culturally adapt and evaluate the psychometric properties of the DQOL-Afaan 
Oromoo (DQOL-AO) among people living with T2D in Ethiopia.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study with a convenience sampling technique was 
conducted in 2020. The DQOL was translated and adapted to Afaan Oromoo. 
Item-total correlations and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) assessed factor 
structure; the Cronbach's alpha assessed internal consistency and relationships 
with gender, educational status, marital status, age, and employment status; and 
status of diabetes-related disease assessed the construct validity of the 
DQOL-AO.
RESULTS: 417 participants responded to all items of the DQOL. Item-total 
correlation analysis and EFA produced a 34-item DQOL-AO with four subscales, 
which demonstrated that the internal consistency of the overall DQOL-AO was 
0.867, and scores were 0.827, 0.846, 0.654, and 0.727 for the impact, 
satisfaction, social/vocational worry, and diabetes-related worry subscales, 
respectively. Statistically significant differences between QOL were obtained in 
educational status (F = 7.164, p < 0.001) and employment status (F = 4.21, p = 
0.002). Individuals who attended college and above and government employees had 
better QOL.
CONCLUSION: The 34-item DQOL-AO provided preliminary evidence as a reliable and 
valid tool to measure diabetic-related QOL before it can be widely used among 
adults living with T2D who speak Afaan Oromoo.

OBJECTIVES: Ongoing, proactive, planned, and patient-centered diabetes education 
is the cornerstone of care for all persons with diabetes. Thus, the aim of this 
study was to explore the information needs of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients 
receiving insulin treatment in North-East Ethiopia.
METHODS: The study was conducted from July 2019 to January 2020 using a 
qualitative enquiry (phenomenological approach) with purposive sampling. 
Face-to-face in-depth interviews were used to collect data until reaching 
theoretical saturation. The participants were type 2 diabetes patients receiving 
insulin treatment. They were identified from the diabetes patients' registration 
book at the diabetes clinic and interviewed at their appointment time, and were 
selected to include wide variations in terms of socio-demographic 
characteristics. Twenty-four participants (11 men and 13 women), with a median 
age of 57 years, were interviewed. The data were organized using QDA Miner Lite 
version 2.0.7 and analyzed thematically using narrative strategies.
RESULTS: Most participants had not heard of diabetes before their diagnosis. 
They had limited knowledge of diabetes, but ascribed different connotations for 
it in the local language (Amharic). The needs reflections of patients were 
categorized into diabetes education and participants' recommendations. Diabetes 
education was totally absent at hospitals, and patients received education 
primarily from the Ethiopian Diabetes Association and broadcast and digital 
media. Thus, the major concern of patients was the availability of diabetes 
education programs at health institutions.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients' main concern was the absence of routine diabetes 
education, which necessitates urgent action to implement diabetes education 
programs, especially at health institutions.

BACKGROUND: Poor glycemic control is a major public health issue among patients 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a significant risk factor for the progression 
of diabetic complications. This study aimed to assess the magnitude and 
contributing factors of poor glycemic control among type 2 diabetes patients on 
follow-up at Adama Hospital Medical College (AHMC) in East Ethiopia.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 245 type 2 diabetes 
patients on follow-up at AHMC from March 1 to 30, 2020. All type 2 diabetes 
patients on follow-up at AHMC and fulfilling the inclusion criteria were 
included in the study. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews 
using structured questionnaires and reviewing the patient chart. The data were 
entered and analyzed using SPSS version 21. The level of significance was 
declared at a p-value of <0.05.
RESULTS: Of the 245 type 2 diabetes patients included in the study, 157 (64.1%) 
had poor glycemic control. The factors associated with poor glycemic control 
were being male (AOR = 2.28, 95% CI [1.24-4.21]), not attending formal education 
(AOR = 3.12, 95% CI [1.53-6.35]), monthly income of <136 USD (AOR = 2.14, 95% CI 
[1.17-3.91]), overweight (AOR = 2.60, 95% CI [1.32-5.10]) and obesity (AOR = 
3.44, 95% CI [1.44-8.21]), and chewing khat (AOR = 2.77, 95% CI [1.04-7.33]).
CONCLUSION: The proportion of poor glycemic control among type 2 diabetes 
patients at AHMC was remarkably high. Therefore, more effort should be taken to 
strengthening and disseminating health education programs for diabetes patients 
at each follow-up visit on the importance of achieving optimal body weight, 
avoiding khat chewing, and maintaining regular physical exercise to prevent and 
mitigate the complications resulting from poor glycemic control.

BACKGROUND: Metformin is the first-line drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. Monitoring vitamin B12 deficiency associated with long-term and 
high-dose therapy is not a common practice in many clinical settings in 
Ethiopia.
OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to measure levels of serum vitamin B12 and folate and 
to assess the macrocytic status of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients on 
metformin.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 80 type 2 diabetes mellitus 
patients who had been on metformin for 5 months or more at the diabetic clinic 
of Tikur Anbessa Specialized Teaching Hospital. Serum vitamin B12 and folate 
levels were quantified by chemiluminescent immunoassays. Mean corpuscular volume 
was determined by complete blood count. Differences in vitamin B12 and folate 
levels and mean corpuscular volume between different groups were assessed using 
Kruskal-Wallis H and Mann-Whitney U tests.
RESULTS: Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency were documented in 5% and 23.8% of 
participants, respectively, and 6.2% of patients were macrocytic. Levels of 
vitamin B12 and folate in patients who had been on metformin >1,500 mg/day ≥4 
years were significantly lower those who had been on metformin 1,000-1,500 
mg/day and <1,000 mg/day <4 years, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Low serum vitamin B12 and folate levels and macrocytosis were found 
to be associated with prolonged metformin treatment.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of death and 
disability among people with diabetes in the world and it is proving to be a 
major barrier to sustainable human development. Despite CVD continuing to 
devastate human survival, few studies in Ethiopia have focused on its prevalence 
which alone are insufficient to assess the risk of incident cardiovascular 
events. Therefore, we determined the incidence and predictors of cardiovascular 
disease among diabetic patients in a selected tertiary healthcare setting of 
Ethiopia.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using secondary data was conducted on 399 
randomly selected diabetes patients. Data were entered using Epi-Data and 
analyzed using Stata version 14. Multivariable Weibull proportional hazards 
regression analysis was used to identify the predictors of CVDs (namely, 
coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and peripheral arterial disease (PAD)) at 
5% level of significance.
RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 5.9 years, the overall incidence rate of 
CVD per 100 person-years (PY) was 2.71 (95% CI=16.9-17.6). The multivariable 
Weibull proportional hazard regression analysis showed a significant association 
of chronic kidney disease (CKD); (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) [95% CI]=2.53 
[1.36-4.72]), systolic blood pressure (SBP)≥140; (AHR [95% CI]=4.30 [2.12-8.73]) 
and triglyceride (TG)≥200 mg/dL; (AHR [95% CI[=5.10 [2.02-12.89]) with risk of 
incident CVD.
CONCLUSION: CVD is a public health problem among diabetic patients in Ethiopia. 
SBP≥140, chronic kidney disease, and high triglyceride were independent 
predictors of new CVD among diabetic patients. These findings emphasize the need 
of attention for CVD patients with CKD and hypertension (HTN) comorbidities and 
a longer follow-up period using a prospective study design to determine the 
long-term effects of predictors of CVD among diabetic patients.

BACKGROUND: Drug related problems interfere with the desired treatment outcomes 
of type 2 Diabetes mellitus. This study was conducted to determine prevalence of 
drug related problems and associated factors among patients with type 2 Diabetes 
Mellitus in public health institutions of Kemisse town, northeast Ethiopia from 
May 01 to 30, 2019.
METHODS: Institution based retrospective cross sectional study was conducted 
among type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patents on follow up at public health 
institutions of Kemisse town, northeast Ethiopia.
RESULT: From the total of 156 patients included in the study, 126 (80.8%) 
patients have at least one drug related problem with a total of 149 drug related 
problems. The most prevalent drug related problems were need for additional drug 
therapy 60 (40.3%) followed by non-compliance 51 (34.2%) and unnecessary drug 
therapy 12 (8%). Identified causes of need for additional drug therapy were the 
need for prophylactic drug therapy (statins and antiplatelet), 83.3%; presence 
of untreated medical condition (Hypertension, diabetic nephropathy and diabetic 
foot ulcer), 11.7%; and the need for combination therapy for better efficacy, 
5%. This study revealed that age ≥45 years (AOR = 5.59, 95% CI = 1.38-20.64, 
P = 0.016), presence of comorbid condition (AOR = 3.22, 95% CI = 1.75-13.47, 
P = 0.014 and emergency visit in the last one year (AOR = 5.08, 95% 
CI = 1.14-18.71, P = 0.033) were significantly associated with the occurrence of 
drug related problems.
CONCLUSION: A total of 149 drug related problems were identified in 80.8% of 
type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. The three most prevalent drug related 
problems were need for additional drug therapy 60 (40.3%) followed by 
non-compliance 51 (34.2%) and unnecessary drug therapy 12 (8%). Additionally, 
age ≥45 years (AOR = 5.59, P = 0.016), presence of comorbidity (AOR = 3.22, 
P = 0.014) and emergency visit in the last one year (AOR = 5.08, P = 0.033) were 
significantly associated with the occurrence of drug related problem.

INTRODUCTION: Diabetes is a global public health threat with a considerably high 
burden in low- and middle-income countries. The application of self-care 
practice by people living with diabetes helps to manage diabetes and its 
complications, and to lengthen their life. However, the level of diabetes 
self-care practice in Ethiopia is very low.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among people living with type 2 
diabetes who were on follow-up from January 01 to 31, 2019 at Yekatit 12 
Hospital. A systematic sampling technique was employed to recruit 354 study 
participants. A face-to-face interview was administered by trained data 
collectors using a structured questionnaire. Diabetes self-care practice was 
assessed by using Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) scale. 
Multi-variable binary logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify 
factors associated with diabetes self-care practice.
RESULTS: More than half (52.0%, 95% CI: 49.9% - 57.1%) of the people living with 
diabetes had poor diabetes self-care practice. Poor self-care practice was 
associated with being unemployed and retired (AOR= 3.57, 95% CI 1.65-7.72), 
having diabetes for ≥10 years (AOR= 1.78, 95% CI 1.07-2.95), having comorbidity 
(AOR= 2.15, 95% CI 1.35-3.43), not owning glucometer (AOR= 1.81, 95% CI 
1.16-2.83), not receiving diabetes education (AOR= 1.95, 95% CI 1.20-3.18) and 
dissatisfaction with social support (AOR= 4.24, 95% CI 1.25-14.40).
CONCLUSION: Poor self-care practice was found to be substantial among people 
living with diabetes in Addis Ababa, with self-monitoring of blood glucose and 
regular exercise being the least performed. It is beneficial to focus more on 
lifestyle modifications and educating about the severity of the disease for 
better management of blood sugar levels and hindrance of complications.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) represents one of the leading causes for 
hospital admissions and outpatient visits. Hence, T2D continuously imposes a 
significant burden to healthcare systems. The aim of this study was to assess 
predictors of hospital admission, readmission rates, and length of hospital stay 
among T2D patients in government hospitals of Eastern Ethiopia from 2013 to 
2017.
METHODS: This study utilized retrospective data from a cohort of T2D patients 
following their treatment in government hospitals in Harari regional state of 
Ethiopia. Predictor of hospital admission was determined using parametric 
survival analysis methods. The readmission rate and length of hospital stay were 
determined by Poisson regression and mixed effect Poisson regression, 
respectively. All association were performed at 95% confidence level. 
Significance of association with determinants was reported using the hazard rate 
for hospital admission, and the incidence rate for readmission and length of 
hospital stay. Optimal model for each outcome was selected by using information 
criteria after fitness was checked.
RESULTS: The hospital admission rate for T2D patients was 9.85 (95%CI: 8.32, 
11.66) per 1000-person-year observation. Alcohol drinking, inactive lifestyle, 
being a rural resident, history of comorbidities, and experiencing chronic 
diabetes complications were predictors of hospital admission. Seventy-one 
(52.2%) of the admitted patients had a history of readmission. Readmission rate 
was increased by being female, duration of disease, inactive lifestyle, having 
BMI greater than 29.9 kg/m2, and higher blood glucose. The median time of 
hospital stay for admitted patients was 18 (IQR:7). The length of hospital stay 
was longer among females, patients with the history of insulin administration, 
and higher blood glucose.
CONCLUSION: Multiple and complex factors were contributing for high diabetes 
admission and readmission rates as well as for longer in-hospital duration among 
T2D patients in Harari regional state. Socio-demographic characteristics (sex, 
place of residence), behavioral factors (alcohol intake, lifestyle), and medical 
conditions (longer duration of disease, comorbidities, chronic diabetes 
complications, higher blood glucose level, and treatment modality) were 
significant determinants of hospital admission, readmission and longer hospital 
stay among T2D patients.

Vascular complication results in serious physical damages which may lead to the 
death of Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Studying the determinant factors of 
changes in blood glucose level and duration of time to the development of 
vascular complications helps to save the lives of citizens. A retrospective 
cohort study was conducted among type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients 
enrolled between December 2011 and December 2012 at Felege Hiwot Referral 
Hospital. A total of 159 T2DM patients were included in the study. Joint 
modelling of longitudinal and survival analysis was employed to identify 
predictors of Blood Glucose Change and Vascular Complication of Type 2 Diabetes 
Mellitus Patients. The prevalence of vascular complication in Type 2 diabetes 
patients was 23.3%. Half of these patients developed an avascular complication 
after 24 months from the onset of the follow-up. The significant predictors of 
shorter time to development of vascular complication were positive proteinuria 
(adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 1.62, CI: 1.08-2.41), increase in the level of 
serum creatinine (AHR = 4.12, CI: 1.94-8.74), cholesterol ≥ 200 mg/dl 
(AHR = 1.54, CI: 1.01-2.35), and log (fasting blood glucose) (AHR = 1.453, CI: 
1.004-2.104). The predictors of progression of fasting blood glucose 
were duration of treatment (CL: - 0.015, - 0.0001), hypertension (CL: 0.018, 
0.098), baseline fasting blood glucose level 126-139 and 140-199 mg/dl (CI: - 
0.40, - 0.31) and (CI: - 0.24, - 0.17), respectively. Male T2DM patients, 
patients with more visits to the hospital and patients who required one oral 
agent had a relatively lower progression of blood sugar level. Type 2 diabetes 
mellitus patients having higher cholesterol level, positive proteinuria, higher 
fasting blood sugar and a lesser number of hospital visits had a higher risk of 
developing a complication.

BACKGROUND: Though initiation of insulin results in a significant change in 
glycemic levels, treating patients without significant hypoglycemic events 
remains difficult in diabetes patients initiated with different insulin-based 
regimens. This study assessed the association of hypoglycemic incidence and 
glycemic control between NPH and premixed insulin regimens in patients with type 
2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study in patients with T2DM who 
were treated with insulin-based therapy from 2015 to 2020 at the University of 
Gondar Comprehensive Specialized hospital. Average fasting blood glucose (FBG) 
between NPH and premixed insulin regimens was compared using an independent 
t-test. The Association of NPH and premixed insulin regimens with hypoglycemic 
incidences and glycemic control was examined by a logistic regression model. P < 
0.05 was statistically significant.
RESULTS: From 405 participants, more than half (55.3%) were males with a mean 
age of 59.2(±9.1) years. Baseline mean HbA1C and FBG levels were 12.73(±1.1) % 
and 347.7(±48.5) mg/dl, respectively. Within a one-year follow-up period of 
insulin initiation, the rate of hypoglycemia was 13.1%. The incidence of 
hypoglycemia was significantly higher in patients initiated with premixed 
insulin compared with NPH insulin regimens (P < 0.001). After one year of 
insulin initiation, HbA1C decreased from 12.7 to 7.6 and from 12.8 to 7.3% and 
FBG levels decreased from 347.5 to 160.7 and from 348.2 to 147.3 mg/dl following 
initiation of NPH and premixed insulin, respectively. Patients treated with 
premixed-based insulin were found more likely to achieve target FBG compared 
with patients treated with NPH insulin regimens after one year of initiation (P 
= 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Premixed insulin-based regimen has found to have a higher 
hypoglycemic incidence, but a better level of glycemic control compared to NPH 
insulin-based therapy. Therefore, patients initiated with premixed insulin need 
to be highly vigilant and motivated to recognize the symptoms of hypoglycemia.

Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most prevalent complication and 
the leading cause of death among patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients have a 2- to 4-fold increased risk of CVD. 
There is a scarcity of data about the magnitude of CVD among patients with 
diabetes in Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated 
factors of CVD among T2DM patients at selected hospitals of Harari regional 
state of Ethiopia. Methods: This hospital-based retrospective data review was 
conducted among T2DM patients on follow-up in the diabetes clinics of selected 
hospitals of Harari regional state. The records of T2DM patients who have been 
diagnosed between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2017, were reviewed from 
March to April 2018. Data were collected by using structured checklists from all 
necessary documents of T2DM patients. Statistical analysis was done using STATA 
14.1. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify 
factors associated with CVD. Result: The records of 454 T2DM patients were 
extracted from three government hospitals in Harari regional state. Their age 
was ranging from 15 to 86 years with a mean age (±SD) of 45.39 (14.76). The 
overall prevalence of CVD among T2DM patients was 42.51%, composed of 
hypertensive heart diseases (38.99%), heart failure (6.83%), and stroke (2.20%). 
The final multivariate logistic regression model revealed that age older than 60 
years [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 3.22; 95% CI: 1.71-6.09], being physically 
inactive (AOR = 1.45; 95 CI: 1.06-2.38), drinking alcohol (AOR = 2.39; 95% CI: 
1.17-6.06), hypertension (AOR = 2.41; 95% CI: 1.52-3.83), body mass index >24.9 
kg/m2 (AOR = 1.81; 95% CI: 1.07-3.07), and experiencing microvascular diabetic 
complications (AOR = 3.62; 95% CI: 2.01-6.53) were significantly associated with 
the odds of having CVD. Conclusion: The prevalence of CVD was high and 
associated with advanced age, physical inactivity, drinking alcohol, higher body 
mass index, hypertension, and having microvascular complications. Health care 
workers should educate T2DM patients about healthy lifestyles like physical 
activity, weight reduction, blood pressure control, and alcohol secession, which 
can reduce the risk of CVD.

BACKGROUND: Although the rate of diabetic nephropathy which is the leading cause 
of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) continues to rise, there is limited 
information about the problem. This study aimed to assess the incidence and 
predictors of diabetic nephropathy among type 2 DM patients.
METHODS: Institution-based retrospective follow-up study was conducted at UGCSH 
with 462 newly diagnosed type 2 DM patients from January 2001 to February 2016, 
and the data were collected by reviewing their records. The Schoenfeld residuals 
test was used to check proportional hazard assumption. The best model was 
selected by using Akaike information criteria (AIC). Hazard ratios (HR) with its 
respective 95% confidence interval were reported to show significance and 
strength of association.
RESULTS: The incidence rate of diabetic nephropathy was 14 (95% CI 10.8-17.7) 
cases per 10,000 patient-month observation. In addition, 63 (13.6%) DM patients 
developed diabetic nephropathy. The median time to develop diabetic nephropathy 
was 94.9 months with interquartile range (IOR) of (64.1-127.4) months. Type 2 DM 
patients who had coronary heart disease (AHR = 2.69, 95% CI 1.42-5.13) and 
anemia (AHR = 1.94, 95% CI 0.97-3.87) were at higher hazard for developing 
diabetic nephropathy. Besides this, having a long duration (>10 years) 
(AHR = 0.24, 95% CI 0.11-0.56) and being female (AHR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.26-0.73) 
was found to be protective against diabetic nephropathy.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of diabetic nephropathy among type 2 diabetes patients 
remains a significant public health problem. Duration of diabetes >10 years and 
female sex reduced the risk of diabetic nephropathy. Coronary heart disease and 
anemia increased the risk of diabetic nephropathy among type 2 DM patients. In 
light of these findings, early screening for diabetes complication is needed, 
and health professionals should give targeted intervention for type 2 DM 
patients with coronary heart disease comorbidity and anemia.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic condition associated with raised 
levels of blood glucose due to the body cannot produce any or enough insulin 
hormone or cannot be effectively utilized the produced insulin by the body. 
Patients with poorly controlled diabetes show a significant alteration in 
various parameters including metabolic, cellular, immunological, and 
hematological disturbances that leads to vascular complications. Thus, the main 
aim of this study is to compare hematological parameters between type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) patients and healthy controls.
METHODS: A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted in Dessie 
comprehensive specialized hospital from January to June 2021. A total of 240 
study participants consisting of 120 T2DM patients and 120 healthy controls were 
recruited using a systematic random sampling technique. Hematological parameters 
were determined using the DIRUI BF6500 automated hematology analyzer. 
Independent T-test was used to compare the mean of hematological parameters 
between T2DM patients and healthy controls. Pearson correlation test was used to 
determine the correlation between FBG, BMI, SBP, DBP, and hematological 
parameters in T2DM patients. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess 
the association between socio-demographic and clinical variables with anemia. 
The result was expressed in mean and standard deviation and presented in texts 
and tables. P-value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
RESULTS: The mean and standard deviation of monocyte count, basophil count, 
monocyte %, basophil %, RBC count, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, RDW-SD, MPV, PDW, 
PLC-R, and plateletcrit showed a significant difference between T2DM patients 
and healthy control group. Pearson correlation coefficient showed that the total 
WBC count, neutrophil count, monocyte count, basophil count, RDW-CV, PDW, MPV, 
PLC-R, and plateletcrit were statistically positively correlated with FBG 
whereas RBC count, Hgb, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, and RDW-SD were statistically 
negatively correlated with FBG in T2DM patients. Moreover, total WBC count, 
neutrophil count, monocyte count, basophil count, Hgb, and plateletcrit were 
statistically positively correlated with BMI while RBC count, Hgb, hematocrit, 
MCV, MCH, and RDW-SD were statistically negatively correlated with BMI in T2DM 
patients. On the other hand, DBP was significantly positively correlated with 
platelet count and RDW-CV whereas SBP also significantly positively correlated 
with total WBC count, neutrophil count, basophil count, and PDW. Besides, DBP 
and SBP showed statistically significant negative correlations with RBC count, 
Hgb level, and Hct value in T2DM patients. The overall prevalence of anemia was 
25.8% in T2DM patients with a higher prevalence of anemia (16.7%) in female 
patients. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that being non-employee 
worker (AOR: 3.6, 95% CI, 1.4-46.0, P = 0.002), presence of neuropathy (AOR: 
13.40, 95% CI, 6.83-26.28, P = 0.00), and duration of the disease ≥ 5 years (AOR 
= 3.2, 95% CI, 1.2-15.3, P = 0.03) have had statistically significant 
association with anemia inT2DM patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with T2DM may have significant alterations in various 
hematological parameters. Hematological parameters should be regularly tested 
for early diagnosis and proper management of diabetes-related complications.

PURPOSE: Platelet indices have been shown to be associated with complications of 
diabetes mellitus (DM). However, the clinical relevance of platelet indices for 
assessing the risk of being microvascular complications among patients with DM 
is largely overlooked. Hence this study aimed to determine the association of 
platelet indices with microvascular complications among type 2 DM patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 
352 type 2 DM patients from April 1 to May 30/2019 at Debre Berhan Referral 
Hospital. Data were collected by interview, physical measurements, document 
review, and laboratory tests. Then the data were entered into Epi-data 
manager-4.4.1.0 and exported into SPSS-25 for analysis. Platelet indices were 
compared between participants with and without microvascular complications using 
an independent t-test. A logistic regression model was used to assess the 
association between microvascular complications and platelet indices. All 
inferences were considered statistically significant at P<0.05.
RESULTS: One hundred seventeen (33.2%) of participants were suffering from at 
least one microvascular complications. The mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet 
distribution width (PDW), and platelet-large cell ratio (P-LCR) were 
significantly increased in DM patients with complications as compared to without 
complications (13.57±2.17fl vs. 11.76±1.93fl), (16.57±2.49fl vs. 14.97±2.41fl) 
and (28.09±7.58% vs. 24.19±6.46%), respectively (all are P˂0.001). In 
multivariate logistic regression analysis, MPV (AOR=1.68, 95% CI: 1.37-2.05), 
PDW (AOR=1.37, 95% CI: 1.15-1.63), P-LCR (AOR=1.07, 95% CI: 1.01-1.14), age 
(AOR=1.07, 95% CI: 1.01-1.12), and duration of DM (AOR=1.31, 95% CI: 1.18-1.46) 
were significantly associated with the presence of microvascular complications.
CONCLUSION: MPV, PDW, and P-LCR were significantly higher among type 2 DM 
patients with microvascular complications. This indicates that platelet indices 
can be used as prognostic markers of vascular complications and can be used as 
simple and cost-effective parameters to predict microvascular complications 
particularly in patients with old age and long duration of DM.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare glycemic control and risk of 
cardiovascular outcomes of metformin-insulin versus metformin-sulfonylurea 
combination therapies in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
METHODS: We conducted a comparative cross-sectional study in five tertiary level 
hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We enrolled 321 patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus who were on continuous treatment follow-up on either 
metformin-insulin or metformin-sulfonylurea combination therapy. We interviewed 
the participants and reviewed their medical records to investigate medication 
efficacy, safety, and adherence. The primary outcome measure was glycemic 
control and the secondary outcome measures were composite cardiovascular 
outcomes.
RESULTS: Of the total participants enrolled, 50.5% (n = 162) were those who 
received metformin-insulin and 49.5% (n = 159) metformin-sulfonylurea 
combination therapies for a median of 48 months follow-up. The reduction of 
Hb1Ac levels was comparable between the metformin-insulin (-1.04 ± 0.96%) and 
metformin-sulfonylurea (-1.02 ± 1.03%), p = 0.912. Patients who received 
metformin-sulfonylurea had 4.3 times more likely to have achieved target HbA1c 
level compared to those who received metformin-insulin, p < 0.001, adjusted odds 
ratio (AOR) with 95% CI = 4.31[1.79-10.32]. Risk of composite cardiovascular 
outcomes was higher in metformin-insulin group (40.5% versus 34.0%), p = 0.021. 
Co-morbidities, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and HbA1c had a 
significant association with composite cardiovascular outcomes. Reductions of 
bodyweight, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides levels, and microvascular complications 
were different between the two groups, p < 0.05.
CONCLUSION: High proportion of patients who received metformin-sulfonylurea 
achieved target HbA1c level and had less composite cardiovascular outcomes 
compared to those who received metformin-insulin. However, these findings have 
to be confirmed with randomized control trials to determine risks associated 
with insulin use, while efficacy is maintained as second-line treatment in 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

AIM: To develop and examine the preliminary effects of a nurse-led, 
community-based diabetes self management education and support program on 
clinical outcomes, self care behaviours, quality of life and family support 
through a pilot randomized controlled trial among adults living with type 2 
diabetes in Western Ethiopia.
METHODS: A two-arm parallel-group pilot randomized controlled trial involving 
participant-caregiver dyads will be conducted. A total of 76 dyads will be 
recruited, with 38 dyads randomly allocated to the intervention arm receiving 
six sessions of the diabetes self management education and support program 
supported by an educational handbook, flier and video on top of the usual care; 
the control arm will continue to receive the usual care. The intervention will 
be guided by social cognitive theory and related international guidelines for 
diabetes management, addressing misconceptions, using culturally tailored foods 
and involving family members in the intervention. Participants will be recruited 
at Nekemte Specialized Hospital over 2 months. Nurses will deliver the 
intervention in the community in Nekemte, western Ethiopia. Diabetes self​ care 
behaviour, quality of life, family support, glycosylated haemoglobin, body mass 
index, blood pressure and lipid profiles will be assessed. Descriptive 
statistics will summarize the sociodemographic variables of the dyads; people 
living with diabetes' clinical outcomes, self care behaviours, quality of life 
and the level of family support; family caregivers' behaviours; and the 
acceptability level. Cohen's d will be computed to estimate the effect size.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The Chinese Clinical Trial Registry prospectively registered 
the trial, and the registration number was ChiCTR2000040292.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and determinants of hyperuricemia among type 
2 diabetic patients on follow-up at Jimma Medical Center from March 1 to June 
30, 2019.
METHODS: This institution-based cross-sectional study was used to assess the 
level of serum uric acid in type 2 diabetic patients attending their follow-up 
at Jimma Medical Center chronic illness clinic. A systematic sampling technique 
was used to include 287 type 2 diabetic patients in the study and an 
interviewer-based questionnaire was used to collect important data from each 
participant. Five milliliters of blood were collected from each participant 
under sterile conditions and serum was separated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm 
for 10 minutes. Serum was stored at -20°C and analyzed for serum uric acid using 
an ABX Pentra 400 clinical chemistry analyzer. Bivariate and multivariable 
binary logistic regression were used to assess significant associations between 
hyperuricemia and independent factors. A p-value of <0.05 was considered 
significant in the final model.
RESULTS: The mean±SD age of the study participants was 51.79±14.36 years. The 
prevalence of hyperuricemia was found to be 22% (n=66/287) in the study 
population. Hyperuricemia was common in those aged ≥60 years and males. Obesity 
(AOR=7.84, 95% CI=2.005-30.666), duration of diabetes mellitus (DM) ≥10 years 
(AOR=3.963, 95% CI=1.902-8.259), family history of CVD (AOR=2.929, 95% 
CI=1.124-7.630), alcohol drinking (AOR=5.83, 95% CI=2.341-14.545) and increased 
DBP (AOR=4.198, 95% CI=1.772-9.949) were determinant variables for hyperuricemia 
in type 2 DM.
CONCLUSION: Hyperuricemia was relatively common among type 2 diabetic patients. 
The prevalence of hyperuricemia was common among patients with obesity, a long 
duration of DM and increased diastolic blood pressure, and alcohol drinkers. 
There is a need to raise awareness of lifestyle modification, healthy behavior 
and early diagnosis of hyperuricemia in type 2 diabetic patients.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a heterogeneous group of metabolic disorders 
characterized by hyperglycemia. The disease is highly associated with 
micro-vascular and macro-vascular complications. Thus, the main aim of this 
study was to compare basic coagulation profiles and platelet parameters among 
type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and healthy 
controls.
METHODS: A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted at Dessie Referral 
Hospital from February to April 2019. A total of 180 study participants 
consisting of (60 T1DM, 60 T2DM, and 60 healthy controls) were enrolled using a 
systematic random sampling technique. Basic coagulation profiles and platelet 
parameters were determined using the HUMACLOT JUNIOR coagulometer and DIRUI BF 
6500 automated hematology analyzer respectively. Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis 
test supplemented with Dunn-Bonferroni correction and Spearman rank-order 
correlation test were used to compare basic coagulation profiles and platelet 
parameters among the groups. The test result was expressed in median and 
interquartile range and presented in texts and tables. P-value < 0.05 was 
considered to be statistically significant.
RESULTS: Prothrombin time (PT) and international normalization ratio (INR) were 
significantly reduced in T2DM as compared to T1DM and healthy controls (p 
<0.05). Platelet distribution width (PDW) and mean platelet volume (MPV) were 
significantly increased in both T1DM and T2DM as compared to healthy controls (p 
<0.05). Moreover, PT and INR were negatively correlated with fasting blood 
glucose (FBG) among T1DM and PT, INR and activated partial thromboplastin time 
(APTT) were negatively correlated with FBG among T2DM.
CONCLUSION: Basic coagulation profiles and platelet parameters were 
significantly different between diabetes and controls where PT and INR in T2DM 
were significantly reduced as compared to T1DM and controls. However, PDW and 
MPV were significantly elevated in both T1DM and T2DM as compared to controls. 
Moreover, FBG was significantly negatively correlated with PT and INR among T1DM 
and FBG was significantly negatively correlated with PT, INR, and APTT among 
T2DM. Therefore, T2DM may be related to increased risk of thrombosis indicated 
by reduced PT and INR and high PDW and MPV than T1DM and controls. Basic 
coagulation profiles and platelet parameters should be regularly tested for 
early diagnosis and proper management of diabetes-related thrombosis.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with a high risk of 
early mortality and morbidity from hypertension. Even though Ethiopia is 
Africa's first country among the top five in the prevalence of DM, there is a 
paucity of data on hypertension and its associated factors among patients with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the 
prevalence and associated factors of hypertension among type 2 diabetes mellitus 
patients at Debre Tabor General Hospital, 2019.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was employed 
on 378 T2DM patients. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered 
questionnaire and analyzed by Stata 14. A multivariable logistic regression 
model was used to identify associated factors of hypertension among T2DM 
patients. Associated factors were declared at p < 0.05.
RESULTS: The prevalence of hypertension among T2DM patients was 59.5% (95% CI: 
54.5-64.5). Stage 1 hypertension was the most common (30.95%). The odds of 
hypertension was higher among age group of 50-60 years (adjusted odds ratio 
(AOR)=2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.27-4.90)), patients from urban area 
(AOR = 2.8, 95% CI (1.08-7.18)), with longer duration of T2DM (AOR =1.16, 95% CI 
(1.08-1.25)), with BMI ≥25 kg/m2 (AOR = 3.2, 95% CI (1.71-5.96)), with poor 
glycemic control (AOR = 3.0, 95% CI (1.75-5.19)), and patients who were current 
cigarette smokers (AOR = 3.8, 95% CI (1.98-14.96)).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of hypertension is high and the majority have poor 
blood pressure control. Hence, DM care providers and other health sector 
stakeholders have to work in collaboration to prevent it through designing 
appropriate strategies especially for those at higher risk of developing 
hypertension.

BACKGROUND: Interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 are the most important cytokine with 
pro and anti-inflammatory activities, respectively. Dysregulation of IL-6 and 
IL-10 are associated with increased risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 
(T2DM). Despite this, a fundamental understanding of both cytokine gene 
polymorphisms with its expression is critical in understanding of cellular 
mechanism of insulin resistance as well as T2DM intervention. Therefore, this 
study aimed to assess IL-6 (- 174 G/C) and IL-10 (- 1082 A/G) gene polymorphism, 
and its association with T2DM, North West Ethiopia.
METHODS: A comparative cross-sectional study from January to May 2018 was 
conducted on study participants with T2DM and apparently healthy controls. 
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction and genotyping was carried out by using 
amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction to detect 
polymorphism of IL-6 and IL-10 gene at the position - 174 and - 1082, 
respectively. The logistic regression model was fitted to assess the association 
of between cytokine gene polymorphisms and T2DM. Odds ratio with 95% CI was 
determined to assess the presence and strength of association between the 
explanatory variables and outcome variable. A P-value < 0.05 was considered as 
statistically significant.
RESULT: Participants carrying the GG genotype of IL-6 (- 174) (OR (95% 
CI) = 4.61 (2.07-10.54) was a high likelihood of having T2DM compared to those 
carrying the CC and AA genotypes. AA and AG genotypes of IL-10 (- 1082) were at 
lower odd of developing T2DM compared to those carrying the GG genotype. In 
addition, individuals carrying the G allele of IL-6 (- 174) have 2.82-fold odds 
of developing T2DM compared to individuals carrying the C allele (OR (95% CI) 
=2.81 (1.78-4.50)).
CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that genetic polymorphisms of IL-6 (- 174) GG 
genotype is the potential host genetic risk factors to T2DM. While, IL-10 
(- 1082) AA genotype is negatively associated with T2DM. Therefore, IL-6 (- 174) 
and IL-10 (- 1082) genetic variation may be considered as a biomarker for early 
screening and diagnosis of T2DM.

INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with hypertension are at high 
risk of drug therapy problems since they are subject to receive multiple drug 
therapies due to comorbidities.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the magnitude of drug therapy problems and its 
determinants among Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with hypertension.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was employed among 423 randomly selected 
participants based on the inclusion criteria. A structured questionnaire and 
review of patients' medical record were employed in the data collection. The 
classification system used by Cipolle was used to classify and evaluate drug 
therapy problems. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the social 
sciences version 25.0 software. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was 
used to identify determinants of drug therapy problems with a statistical 
significance of p ⩽ 0.05.
RESULTS: A total of 491 drug therapy problems with a mean of 1.86 ± 0.53 drug 
therapy problems per patient were identified, and 62.4% (264) of them 
experienced at least one drug therapy problem. Non-compliance (197, 40.1%), 
needs of additional drug therapy (119, 24.2%), and dosage too low (91, 18.5%) 
were the most frequently observed drug therapy problems in the study setting. 
Anti-diabetic medications (88.4%), statins (44.5%), and aspirin (33.5%) were the 
most commonly involved drugs in drug therapy problems. The determinants of drug 
therapy problems were very low family income (adjusted odds ratio = 4.64, 
p = 0.010), age (45-65 years old) (adjusted odds ratio = 2.55, p = 0.008), 
presence of comorbidity (adjusted odds ratio = 9.19, p < 0.001), and taking ⩾5 
medications (adjusted odds ratio = 2.84, p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Approximately three out of five patients had one or more drug 
therapy problems encountered. In this study, the most common types of drug 
therapy problems were non-compliance, needs additional drug therapy, and dosage 
too low. Family monthly income, age, comorbidities, and number of medications 
were the significant determinants of drug therapy problems. Therefore, patient 
education regarding medication adherence, routine medication review, and 
strengthening clinical pharmacy services should be promoted.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome is rising at an alarming rate 
and more common among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients in the world. The risk 
for cardiovascular disease is greater among individuals who have a combination 
of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and metabolic syndrome compared to those who have 
either alone.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the proportion of metabolic syndrome and lifestyle factors 
among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients in Dessie Referral Hospital, Amhara 
Region, Ethiopia.
METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February to 
March 2017 among 343 randomly selected Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients. Three 
definitions of Metabolic syndrome were considered. Multivariable logistic 
regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with metabolic 
syndrome. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were 
reported to show the strength of association. Statistical significance was 
declared at P-value < 0.05.
RESULT: The proportion of metabolic syndrome was 50.3%, 59.4% and 64.5% 
according to 2005 International Diabetes Federation, revised ATP III and 2009 
harmonized criteria, respectively. Being female (AOR = 2.43; 95% CI = 1.40, 
4.21), consumption of red meat (AOR = 2.61; 95% CI = 1.28, 5.33), sedentary 
leisure time activity (AOR = 2.65; 95% CI = 1.47, 4.78), coffee intake (AOR = 
0.43; 95% CI = 0.21, 0.86), BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 (AOR = 9.59; 95% CI = 4.98, 18.47), 
40-49 years of age (AOR = 2.74, 95% CI = (1.02, 7.37), 50-59 years of age (AOR = 
4.22; 95% CI = 1.60, 11.11) and ≥70 years of age (AOR = 4.51, 95% CI = 1.44, 
14.15) were significantly associated with metabolic syndrome.
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: The proportion of metabolic syndrome was high 
among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients. Overweight and obesity, being female, 
age of respondent, intake of coffee, regular red meat consumption, and sedentary 
leisure-time activity were factors associated with metabolic syndrome. 
Counseling of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients on the need for spending leisure 
time with activities, intake of coffee, control of body weight, and avoidance of 
regular red meat consumption is recommended.

BACKGROUND: Medication nonadherence in patients with chronic diseases, 
particularly in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with comorbidity, has continued 
to be the cause of treatment failure. The current study assessed medication 
adherence and its impact on glycemic control in T2DM patients with comorbidity.
METHODS: An institutional-based multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted 
among T2DM patients with comorbidity at the selected hospitals in Northwest 
Ethiopia. Medication adherence was measured using a structured questionnaire of 
the General Medication Adherence Scale (GMAS). A logistic regression model was 
used to identify predictors of the level of medication adherence and glycemic 
control. P < 0.05 at 95% confidence interval (CI) was statistically significant.
RESULTS: A total of 403 samples were included in the final study. This study 
showed that more than three-fourths (76.9%) of the participants were under a low 
level of medication adherence. Source of medication cost coverage [AOR = 10.593, 
95% CI (2.628-41.835; P = 0.003], monthly income (P < 0.00), self-monitoring of 
blood glucose (SMBG) practice [AOR = 0.266, 95% CI (0.117-0.604); P = 0.002], 
number of medications [AOR = 0.068, 95% CI (0.004-0.813); P = 0.014] and medical 
conditions [AOR = 0.307, 95% CI (0.026-0.437); P = 0.018] were found to be 
significant predictors of medication adherence. Significantly, majority (74.7%) 
of participants had poor levels of glycemic control. Patients who had a high 
level of medication adherence [AOR = 0.003, 95% CI (0.000-0.113); P = 0.002] 
were found less likely to have poor glycemic control compared with patients who 
were low adherent to their medications.
CONCLUSION: The current study concluded that medication adherence was low and 
significantly associated with poor glycemic control. Number of medical 
conditions and medications were found to be associated with medication 
adherence. Management interventions of T2DM patients with comorbidity should 
focus on the improvement of medication adherence.

BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, therefore 
having a major impact on the overall health and survival of diabetic patients. 
However, there is a paucity of evidence of anemia among diabetic patients in 
Ethiopia, particularly in Harari Region. Therefore, this study aimed to assess 
the magnitude of anemia and associated factors among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 
(T2DM) patients attending public hospitals in Harari Region, Eastern Ethiopia.
METHODS: A hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted from February 25 
to March 30, 2019. Probability proportion to size sampling, followed by simple 
random sampling, was utilized to select 374 T2DM patients. To collect the data, 
mixed methods were applied using questionnaires and checklist. Participants were 
tested for anemia based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Data was 
double entered to EpiData version 3.1 and exported into Stata version 14.0 for 
statistical analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were 
fitted; Crude Odds Ratio (COR) and Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with 95% Confidence 
Interval (CI) were computed. Level of significance was declared at p-value less 
than 0.05.
RESULTS: The study revealed 34.8% of the participants were anemic (CI: 28.7, 
40.9). Being male (AOR = 2.92, CI: 1.65, 5.17), physical inactivity (AOR = 2.58, 
CI: 1.50, 4.44), having nephropathy (AOR = 2.43, CI: 1.41, 4.21), poor glycemic 
control (AOR = 1.98, CI: 1.17, 3.34), recent history of blood loss (AOR = 4.41, 
CI: 1.26, 15.44) and duration of diabetes for five years and greater(AOR = 1.72, 
CI: 1.01, 2.96)were all significantly associated with anemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Anemia was a major health problem among T2DM patients in the study 
area. Therefore, routine screening of anemia for all T2DM patients aiding in 
early identification and improved management of diabetes will lead to improved 
quality of life in this patient population.

OBJECTIVE: This study carried out to describe urban-rural differences in the 
trend of type 1 and type 2 diabetes among adults who have received medical 
treatment from public hospitals over the last five years.
METHODS: The trends of adult diabetes assessed from September 1, 2013, to August 
31, 2018, using hospital-based retrospective medical records of 299,806 adult 
patients in the adult medical outpatient and emergency units. Data were 
collected using a uniform data abstraction format. An extended Mantel-Haenszel 
chi-square test of the linear trend used to examine the trend over time.
RESULTS: Of the total 299,806 adult patients, 3056 (1.02% (95% CI: 0.98-1.06)) 
patients were confirmed diabetes patients. The overall trend in the proportion 
of diabetes had increased from 6.8 to 14.3 per 1000 adult patients. The trend of 
type 1 diabetes increased for both urban from 1.0 to 2.2 per 1000 adult urban 
residents and rural from 1.2 to 2.6 per 1000 adult rural residents, with 
statistically a significant increase (χ2= 9.1, P=0.002) and (χ2=17.8, P<0.001) 
for linear trend, respectively. The trend of type 2 diabetes increased for both 
urban from 6.9 to 14.0 per 1000 adult urban residents and rural from 4.0 to 9.5 
per 1000 adult rural residents, with a statistically significant increase 
(χ2=68.4, P<0.001) and (χ2=74.2, P<0.001) for linear trend, respectively. The 
higher increase in the proportion of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes observed 
among women patients.
CONCLUSION: The trend in the proportion of type 1 and type 2 diabetes increasing 
for both urban and rural residents, with a higher increase observed among women. 
These findings highlight health-care professionals and policymakers to design 
effective public health policies to treat each type of disease.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the level of aspartate aminotransaminase 
(AST), alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and 
their association with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Northwest Ethiopia.
RESULTS: Using a cross-sectional study, blood samples were collected from 192 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) participants and 192 healthy age and sex-matched 
volunteers. The study was carried out from May to August 2017. The serum 
concentration of aspartate aminotransaminase, alanine aminotransaminase, and 
gamma-glutamyltransferase were measured using A25 Bio-system fully automatic 
chemistry analyzer and using the manufacturer's kit of the machine. Liver 
function test results of T2DM participant were significantly higher than those 
of the control group, serum ALT (46.06 ± 22. 38 IU/L) and serum AST (42.94 ± 19. 
08 IU/L), P < 0.001, while the level of GGT in both study groups was not 
significantly associated (P = 0.065). In conclusion, the evaluation of liver 
marker enzymes showed a significant association with Type 2 diabetes 
participants compared with the controls.

PURPOSE: Anemia is one of the common complications of diabetes mellitus (DM), 
which has an adverse effect on the progression and development of other 
diabetes-related complications. In spite of this, relatively little information 
is available on the prevalence of anemia and associated factors among type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients in Ethiopia, particularly in the study area. 
Thus, this study assessed the prevalence of anemia and associated factors among 
T2DM patients at Debre Berhan Referral Hospital (DBRH), North-East, Ethiopia.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 
April 1 to May 30, 2019, among 249 T2DM patients with follow up at DBRH, 
selected using a systematic random sampling technique. Data were collected by 
face-to-face interviews, anthropometric measurements, and laboratory tests; such 
as hemoglobin measurements, red blood indices, and serum creatinine analysis. 
The data were coded and entered into Epi-data manager version 4.4.1.0, and 
analysis by using SPSS version 22 was carried out. To identify the determinant 
factors of anemia, bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were 
performed. P-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
RESULTS: The study showed 20.1% of the participants were anemic. Being age >60 
years (AOR=3.06, 95% CI: 1.32-7.11), poor glycemic control (AOR=2.95, 95% CI: 
1.22-7.15), eGFR 60-89.9 mL/min/1.73m2 (AOR=2.91, 95% CI: 1.15-7.37), eGFR <60 
mL/min/1.73m2 (AOR=6.58, 95% CI: 2.42-17.93), DM duration >10 years (AOR= 
AOR=2.75, 95% CI: 1.17-6.48), and having diabetic complications (AOR=3.81, 95% 
CI: 1.65-8.81) were significantly associated with anemia.
CONCLUSION: One out of five T2DM patients had anemia. Poor glycemic control, 
decreased eGFR, presence of DM complications, duration of DM >10 years, and age 
>60 years were significantly associated with the occurrence of anemia among 
T2DM. Regular screening for anemia in all T2DM patients may help in the early 
detection and management of anemia.

BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD), one of the major macrovascular 
complications of diabetes, is associated with cardiovascular mortality and a 
high rate of disability following the amputation of an extremity in diabetes 
patients. However, there is no data on the prevalence of PAD among type 2 
diabetes patients in Ethiopia. Therefore, the current study is aimed at 
determining the prevalence and associated factors of PAD among type 2 diabetes 
patients at Debre Tabor General Hospital, Debre Tabor, Northwest Ethiopia.
METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among type 2 
diabetes mellitus patients from February 1 to August 30, 2019. A pretested 
interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. The 
presence of stenosis and its grading were determined by color Doppler 
ultrasonography. Data were entered using EpiData-V.4.6 and analyzed by STATA-14. 
Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify 
associated factors of peripheral arterial disease. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 
its confidence interval were estimated for potential predictors included in the 
final model. P ≤ 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance.
RESULTS: The mean age of the study participants was 61.2 ± 7.3 years. One 
hundred seventy-two (61.4%) patients were males. The prevalence of PAD in this 
study was 30.7% (95% CI (25.3-36.2%)). Of these, 37 (43%) were symptomatic. Age 
(AOR = 1.09, 95% CI (1.03-1.16)), higher HbA1c (AOR = 1.97, 95% CI (1.03-3.40)), 
being an ex-smoker (AOR = 4.68, 95% CI (1.93-11.30)), and current cigarette 
smoking (AOR = 5.84, 95% CI (1.79-19.04)) were significantly associated with 
PAD.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease among type 2 diabetes 
patients was high. Increasing age, high HbA1c, and being cigarette smokers 
increase the likelihood of developing peripheral arterial disease. Clinicians 
should prevent PAD; screen T2DM patients who are aged, with high HbA1c, and 
cigarette smokers; and treat them timely.

BACKGROUND: Dietary modification is the cornerstone and initial recommendation 
in the management of diabetes mellitus. Adhering to the recommended dietary 
practice has a significant role in diabetic control, but not uniformly 
practised.
OBJECTIVE: To assess dietary adherence and glycemic control among type 2 
diabetic patients on follow-up at Dilchora Referral Hospital (DRH), Dire Dawa, 
Eastern Ethiopia.
METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 22 August to 
23 October 2019, at DRH. Data were collected through an interviewer-administered 
questionnaire. The Perceived Dietary Adherence Questionnaire (PDAQ) was used to 
estimate the level of dietary adherence. Glycemic control was measured using 
fasting blood glucose. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed 
to identify factors associated with dietary adherence.
RESULTS: Of the 307 included patients, 62.5% were poorly adherent to the 
recommended diet. Lack of dietary education (83.38%) and inability to afford a 
healthy diet (71.33%) were the perceived barriers to practice dietary 
recommendation. More than half (54.7%) failed to achieve the recommended fasting 
blood glucose target. In multivariate logistic regression, patients who were 
adherent to dietary recommendations were 3.56 times more likely to have good 
glycemic control. Those patients living in urban areas, having monthly income 
greater than 1000 Ethiopia Birr, family history of the disease, duration of 
treatment greater than 10 years and who received counseling were more likely to 
have good dietary adherence.
CONCLUSION: The level of adherence to the dietary recommendation and glycemic 
control was low. Healthcare providers should be proactive in tackling the 
barrier for non-adherence and should promote adherence to dietary 
recommendations in T2DM patients.

BACKGROUND: ABO and Rh blood group antigens are thought to be among genetic 
determinants of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Identification of blood group 
phenotypes are more associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It will be helpful 
for individuals who are susceptible blood groups to take care of themselves by 
avoiding other predisposing factors and taking preventive measures.
METHODS: Hospital-based comparative cross-sectional study was carried out from 
February to April 2019 at Felege Hiwot Comprehensive Referral Hospital. 
Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected with a semistructured 
pretested questionnaire. ABO and Rh Blood group were determined by slide and 
test tube methods. Biochemical parameters were determined with Mindray BS-200E 
fully automated clinical chemistry analyzer. Data were analyzed by IBM SPSS 
version 20 statistical software. Chi-square test and logistic regression 
analysis were employed for data analysis. A P value of < 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant.
RESULTS: From a total of 424 participants included for this study, blood group O 
was found higher in frequency with 74 (34.9%) and 97 (45.75%) for cases and 
healthy controls, respectively. ABO blood groups showed significant association 
with T2DM, a chi-square value of 12.163 and P value of 0.007. However, the Rh 
blood group was not associated with T2DM. Binary logistic regression analysis 
revealed that blood group B had a higher risk (OR: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.33-3.32) and 
blood group O had decreased risk (OR: 0.636, 95% CI: 0.43-0.94) of T2DM as 
compared to other blood groups.
CONCLUSION: ABO blood group antigens showed significant association with type 2 
diabetes mellitus. Blood group B was associated with an increased risk and O 
blood group with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of poor sleep 
quality and its associated factors among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus at 
Jimma University Medical Center, Jimma, Ethiopia 2018. Comparative 
cross-sectional study was employed on 198 participants (99 cases and 99 
controls). Data were collected using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and 
analyzed using SPSS version 20. Variables with p value ≤ 0.05 in multivariable 
logistic regression were treated as significant predictors of poor sleep 
quality.
RESULTS: The prevalence of poor sleep quality was 55.6% among people with type 2 
diabetes mellitus and 32.3% among controls. Longer duration of diabetes since 
diagnosis (> 10 years) [AOR = 4.88 CI (1.27, 18.66) p = 0.021], co-morbid 
hypertension [AOR = 3.2, CI (1.16, 8.84) p = 0.025], poor glycemic control 
[AOR = 3.16 CI (1.2, 8.27), p = 0.02] and current khat chewing [AOR = 3.06, CI 
(1.04, 8.98), p = 0.042] were factors significantly associated with poor sleep 
quality. The prevalence of poor sleep quality was significantly higher among 
people with diabetes than those who didn't have diabetes (controls). Poor sleep 
quality may bring about mental impairment and reduce working capacity of 
individuals with diabetes mellitus. Therefore, diabetes mellitus patients need 
to have heath education about risk factors for poor sleep quality.

OBJECTIVE: To assess magnitude of overweight and associated factors among type 2 
diabetes mellitus patients at Mekelle public hospitals, Tigray, Ethiopia.
RESULTS: A total of 365 participants were enrolled in this study. One hundred 
ninety-eight (54.2%) of the participants were males and 288 (78.9%) of the study 
participants were from an urban residence. In this study 161 (44.1%) and 12 
(3.3%) of the study subjects were alcohol consumers and smokers respectively. 
Besides, 166 (45%) of the study participants had poor dietary intake and around 
302 (82.7%) had low level of vigorous physical activity. The proportion of 
individuals who were overweight using body mass index as a measure was 149 
(40.8%) and the proportion of individuals who had central obesity using waist 
circumference as a measure was 194 (53.2%). The magnitude of overweight among 
study participants from urban residence and alcohol consumers was 138 (92.6%) 
and 93 (62.4%) respectively. Residence area, alcohol consumption, physical 
activities, central obesity and dietary intake were the determinant factors for 
overweight among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.

BACKGROUND: Although it is largely preventable, type 2 diabetes is the most 
common type and accounts for the vast majority of diabetes cases worldwide.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity and reliability of the Amharic version of the 
abbreviated World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) instrument 
for measuring quality of life in people with diagnosed type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: The Amharic version of the abbreviated World Health Organization 
Quality of Life instrument was administered to 344 patients with diagnosed type 
2 diabetes in Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital. Contribution of domain scores to 
QOL facets was assessed using multiple linear regression. Reliability assessment 
was done by using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Construct validity was examined 
using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses.
RESULT: The Amharic version of the abbreviated World Health Organization Quality 
of Life instrument has acceptable internal consistency. Confirmatory factor 
analysis has shown acceptable goodness of fit for 4 domain models. The physical, 
psychological, and environmental domains have a statistically significant 
contribution in explaining overall quality of life, while only physical and 
psychological domains have significant contribution in explaining the general 
health facet.
CONCLUSION: The Amharic version of the abbreviated World Health Organization 
Quality of Life instrument is appropriate for patients with diagnosed type 2 
diabetes. The overall finding of analysis implies that the Amharic version of 
the abbreviated World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument has 
internal consistency and validity to investigate quality of life among patients 
with diagnosed type 2 diabetes, and it can be used for studies which are going 
to be conducted in Ethiopia.

BACKGROUND: Knowing when to start insulin is central to optimal management of 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) but a real clinical challenge. Poor glycemic 
control is critical for development of the deadly diabetic complications.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the appropriateness of insulin 
commencement, adequacy of glycemic control and associated factors among patients 
with T2DM.
SETTINGS: The study was conducted at three public hospitals in Southwest 
Ethiopia.
METHODS: Cross sectional study was conducted using structured questionnaire and 
data abstraction format. All patients with T2DM who were available during the 
data collection period and fulfilling study criteria were included.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was done 
for identifying factors associated with poor glycemic control by taking 
statistical significance at p value ≤0.05.
RESULTS: One hundred sixty nine patient data was considered for analysis. 
Insulin was initiated in 28 patients, but only 10(35.7%) insulin commencements 
were appropriate. More than two third (70.4%) of the studied population had poor 
glycemic control. Addition of second antidiabetic medication (Adjusted Odds 
Ratio (AOR) = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.3-6.2) and living in urban areas (AOR = 2.5, 95% 
CI = 1.1-5.7) were associated with poor glycemic control while having regular 
diabetic care follow up of every >1 month (AOR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.2-0.9) was 
negatively associated with poor glycemic control.
CONCLUSIONS: About two third of insulin commencements were inappropriate and 
majority of patients could not stay on optimal glycemic control. Addition of 
second antidiabetic medication and living in urban areas were found to be 
associated with poor glycemic control.
IMPACT OF FINDINGS ON PRACTICE STATEMENTS: • Initiation of insulin before 
optimization of oral agents increase cost of care.• Proper titration of the 
first oral agent is important prior to adding other antidiabetic agents.• 
Emphasis should be given to improve glycemic control, and hence halt subsequent 
complications.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes is increasing at an alarming rate throughout the world, and 
~80% of diabetics live in developing countries. Similar to the rest of 
sub-Saharan African countries, Ethiopia is experiencing a significant burden of 
diabetes, with increased prevalence, complications, and mortality, as well as 
life threatening disabilities. Reasons for poor glycemic control among type 2 
diabetes patients are complex and multivariable. Hence, this study aimed to 
identify challenges and factors associated with poor glycemic control among type 
2 diabetes patients.
METHOD: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among type 2 
diabetic patients attending the diabetic clinic of Nekemte Referral Hospital 
(NRH) from February 1 to April 30, 2018. Fasting blood glucose levels of the 
last three clinic visits were obtained and the mean fasting blood glucose 
measurement was used to determine the level of glycemic control. Analysis 
included both descriptive and inferential statistics with SPSS version 20.0. 
Predictor variable P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Out of the total 228 included type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients, 
51.8% were males. The mean age of patients was 43±12.4 years and 154 (67.5%) 
were found to not be following their general dietary program correctly. Nearly 
one third, 73 (32%), of patients never attended diabetic education and 52 
(22.8%) of the patients had greater than 10 years' duration on treatment. The 
majority, 148 (64.9%), of patients had poor blood glucose control. Age 40-60 
years (AOR=2.01, 95% CI=0.04-0.06, P=0.044), being illiterate (AOR=3.12, 95% 
CI=1.52-8.50, P=0.001), having informal education only (AOR=2.28, 95% 
CI=2.14-32.60, P=0.024), longer duration of diabetes treatment (>10 years) 
(AOR=3.94, 95% CI=1.51-27.83, P=0.012), inadequate physical exercise (AOR=3.19, 
95% CI=1.05-19.84, P=0.019), and smoking (AOR=4.51, 95% CI=0.00-0.50, P=0.022) 
were independent predictors of poor glycemic control on multivariable logistic 
regression analysis.
CONCLUSION: Nearly two-thirds of patients had poorly controlled diabetes. Age, 
exercise, level of education, duration of the treatment, and smoking were 
significantly associated with poor glycemic control. Health facilities should 
provide continuous education, and barriers of glycemic control should be 
explored with further research.

BACKGROUND: Nonadherence to lifestyle modification recommendations is a major 
challenge in the management of diabetes mellitus. This study was conducted to 
measure the prevalence and predictors of nonadherence to diet and physical 
activity recommendations among type 2 diabetes patients (T2D).
METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving 322 type 2 diabetes patients was 
conducted from April 1 to June 30, 2019. Data were collected through 
face-to-face interviews using structured and pretested questionnaire. Data on 
sociodemographic, psychosocial, and clinical characteristics were collected. 
Descriptive analytical results were reported in text, tables, and figures. 
Logistic regression was conducted to identify predictors of nonadherence to diet 
and physical activity. Variables with p value ≤0.25 in bivariate logistic 
regression were considered as candidates for multivariable regression. 
Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify independent 
predictors. Odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals together with p value 
≤0.25 in bivariate logistic regression were considered as candidates for 
multivariable regression. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to 
identify independent predictors. Odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals 
together with.
RESULT: The rate of nonadherence to physical activity and diet was 64.3% and 
36%, respectively. Female gender (AOR: 2.6, 95% CI [1.52-4.56]), age > 60 years 
(AOR: 2.9, 95% CI [1.12-7.42]), being illiterate (AOR: 4.2, 95% CI [1.86-9.73]), 
diabetes duration of >5 years (AOR: 2.5, 95% CI [1.42-4.41]), and lack of social 
support (AOR: 2.4, 95% CI [1.42-4.35]) were independent predictors of 
nonadherence to physical activity recommendations. Factors associated with 
nonadherence to dietary recommendations were being male (AOR = 2.8, 95% CI: 
[1.35-5.65]), age > 60 years (AOR = 6.3, 95% CI: [2.21-18.17]), khat chewing 
(AOR = 8.0, 95% CI: [3.86-16.7]), lack of social support (AOR = 15.26, 95% 
CI = [7.45-32.8]), and doctor's instructions or advice regarding diet 
(AOR = 8.9, 95% CI = [4.26-18.9]).
CONCLUSION: The rate of nonadherence to diet and physical activity 
recommendations was high in the study area. Predictors of nonadherence to 
physical activity are female gender, age > 60 years, being illiterate, diabetes 
duration of >5 years, and lack of social support. Predictors of nonadherence to 
diet are being male, khat chewing, lack of social support, and doctor's 
instructions or advice regarding diet.

INTRODUCTION: Ethiopia has been exhibiting trends that are shifting the 
populace's way of life toward urbanization. As a result, the country's primary 
focus is on treating infectious diseases, whereas chronic noncommunicable 
diseases receive less attention. Type 2 diabetes has emerged as a major 
noncommunicable disease that is endangering African nations' economic, social, 
and cultural underpinnings. There has been research mostly on prevalence, 
factors associated, and glycemic control of diabetes but not adequate on the 
causes of T2DM in Ethiopia, particularly in the study region.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the determinants of type 2 diabetes mellitus among adults 
at Dill-Chora hospital, from August 30 to October 30, 2021.
METHODS: An unmatched case-control study was carried out at Dill-Chora referral 
hospital using face-to-face interviews. The data was collected, cleaned, coded, 
and entered to epi data version 3.1 before being exported to SPSS version 23 for 
analysis. The analyses used were descriptive and logistic regression.
RESULTS: The study included 331 individuals, 113 cases and 218 controls. 
Cigarette smoking (AOR: 3.15, 95% CI: 1.24-7.96), extra salt consumption (AOR: 
5.52, 95% CI: 2.33-13.05), low fruit consumption (AOR: 5.28, 95% CI: 
2.12-13.16), infrequent physical activity (AOR: 3.72, 95% CI: 1.65-8.39), waist 
to hip ratio (AOR: 18.88, 95% CI: 7.35-48.42), and triglyceride level (AOR: 
2.93, 95% CI: 1.34-6.32) were strongly linked to the onset of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus.
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: This study discovered a variety of risk factors 
for type 2 diabetes, including triglyceride levels, fruit consumption, smoking, 
increased salt consumption, irregular exercise, and waist to hip ratio. By 
focusing preventative efforts on these risk factors, the occurrence of type 2 
diabetes may be reduced. Furthermore, diabetes mellitus screening is crucial, 
particularly in those with a high waist-to-hip ratio, a smoking history, and 
high triglyceride levels.

BACKGROUND: Self-care practices in diabetes patients are crucial to keep the 
illness under control and prevent complications. Effective management of 
diabetes will be a difficult task without adequate understanding of the existing 
level of practice related to diabetes self-care. This study is, therefore, aimed 
at assessing the self-care practice and its associated factors among patients 
with type 2 diabetes in Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Ethiopia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A health facility-based cross-sectional study was 
conducted among 419 type 2 diabetes patients from March 29, 2013, to May 16, 
2013. The data were collected by face-to-face interview using structured and 
pretested questionnaire. Binary logistic regression was performed to assess the 
association between determinant factors and adherence to self-monitoring of 
blood glucose. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) 
were estimated to identify factors associated with the outcome variables in the 
multivariable analysis.
RESULT: In this study, 318 (75.9%) diabetes patients did not adhere to the 
recommended diet management, 350 (83.5%) did not adhere to self-monitoring of 
blood glucose level, while 18 (4.3%) of the respondents did not adhere to the 
prescribed medications. Diabetic patients who were unemployed were 2.4 times 
more likely to practice blood glucose monitoring than merchants (AOR [95% CI] 
=2.4 [1.3-5.9]). Those who attended primary education were 70% less likely to 
adhere to blood glucose self-monitoring than those educated to a tertiary 
educational level (AOR [95% CI] =0.3 [0.1-0.9]). Respondents within the age 
group of 40-49 years were 11 times more likely to adhere to their medication 
than those aged 60-76 years (AOR [95% CI] =11 [1.03-13.6]).
CONCLUSION: The study showed that the extent to which individuals adhere to the 
recommended management of type 2 diabetes is substantially low. Improving 
awareness of patients and the community at large is imperative especially on 
medication adherence, glycemic control and diet management.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic disease and can be self-managed using 
five treatment approaches, including education, medical nutrition therapy, 
physical exercise, pharmacological intervention, and blood sugar monitoring. 
Improvement of patient compliance and self-efficacy are critical points that 
impact the self-care behavior in patients with type two diabetes mellitus in 
order to limit the morbidity and promote glycemic control. Therefore, the 
present study successfully assesses the effect of perceived self-efficacy and 
associated factors among patients with diabetes mellitus at public hospitals of 
western Ethiopia.
METHODS: The cross-sectional study design was employed on a sample of 423 
diabetic patients. A systematic random sampling method was employed. An 
interviewer-administered structured questionnaire was used. The data entered 
into Epi data version 3.1 and exported into Statistical Package for the Social 
Sciences window version 24 for analysis. All variables significant at p <0.25 in 
bivariate were entered into multivariate analysis. The multivariable logistic 
regressions were used to determine factors associated with perceived 
self-efficacy by considering adjusted odds ratio at CI 95% and the significance 
level was set at p <0.05.
RESULTS: Out of 423 participants sampled, 398 participated in the study giving a 
response rate of 94.1%. The level of perceived good self-efficacy among diabetes 
patients was 52.5%. Being married (AOR=1.611, 95% CI = 1.003, 2.587), home blood 
glucose test (AOR=3.359, 95% CI = 1.912,5.903), doing exercise (AOR=11.412, 95% 
CI = 2.488,52.346), having good appetite (AOR=2.587, 95% CI = 1.454,4.606), 
having special diet (AOR=4.902, 95% CI= 1.202, 19.992), and good self-care 
behavior (AOR=10.320, 95% CI= 5.657, 18.824) were significantly associated with 
good self-efficacy.
CONCLUSION: The level of perceived self-efficacy was high. Home blood glucose 
tests, good self-care behavior, married, doing exercise, good appetite, having a 
special diet were significantly associated with high perceived self-efficacy. 
The national policymaker focused on patients' behavioral change to develop 
perceived self-efficacy for confidently managing the disease.

BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a periodic, partial or complete 
obstruction in the upper airway during sleep that disrupts normal sleep pattern. 
Despite its significant morbidities and mortality, the majority of patients with 
OSA remain undiagnosed. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence 
and associated factors of OSA risk among type 2 diabetes patients on follow up 
at Jimma Medical Center from January 13 to March 2, 2020.
METHOD: A hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted and consecutive 
sampling technique was employed. The stop bang questionnaire was used to assess 
OSA risk. Data were collected using structured questionnaire and entered into 
EPI data 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Logistic regression 
was employed to identify factors associated with high risk OSA. A variable 
having a p-value of <0.2 in the bivariate model was subjected to multivariate 
analysis. Adjusted odds ratios were calculated at 95% confidence interval and 
considered significant with a p-value of ≤0.05.
RESULT: 253 patients seen in the outpatient clinic were involved with mean age 
and mean duration of diabetes was 50.27 ± 14.08 and 6.48 ± 5.20 years 
respectively. The study finding showed that the prevalence of high risk OSA was 
45.5%. According to multivariate analysis comorbid hypertension (AOR = 2; 95% 
CI: 1.04, 3.89), physical inactivity (AOR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.11,4), 
BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2: (AOR = 5.41; 95% CI: 1.68,17.3 and neck circumference > 40 cm: 
(AOR = 6.3; 95% CI: 2.8,14.2 were independently associated with an increased 
risk of OSA.
CONCLUSION: There is high number of participants with high risk of OSA. BMI 
of ≥ 30 kg/m2, physical inactivity, neck circumference of > 40 cm and comorbid 
hypertension were associated with high risk OSA among participants. Early 
detection and appropriate interventions are important among high risk groups.

BACKGROUND: Despite how much effect of low health literacy is on diabetic 
treatment cannot be accurate, it has an impact on controlling blood glucose 
level. Less is known about diabetic health literacy in Ethiopian diabetic 
patients which can affect patient medication adherence, self-care, and glycemic 
control.
OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to assess the diabetic health literacy level and 
its association with glycemic control among adult patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus attending the outpatient clinic of University of Gondar Comprehensive 
Specialized Hospital (UOGCSH): Northwest Ethiopia.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was employed at the outpatient clinic of the 
University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from May, 1 -May 30, 
2019. The comprehensive 15-items diabetic health literacy questions with a 
5-point Likert scale used to measure diabetic health literacy. The mean score 
calculated and switched to the percentage (5 points as 100%) to determine the 
level of diabetic health literacy. Morisky Green Levine Scale 4 item adherence 
assessment tool was used to assess the diabetic patient's level of adherence. 
Binary and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the 
association between sociodemographic, clinical variables, diabetic-related 
literacy, and glycemic control. Independent samples t-test and One-way ANOVA 
test was employed to compare the mean literacy score difference in different 
groups.
RESULT: 400 respondents were included in the study. Of all the respondents, 
17.3%, 26.3%, and 56.5% had low, medium and high diabetic-related health 
literacy, respectively. The proportions of patients with low, medium and high 
adherence to medication were 9.8%, 56.3%, and 34% respectively. Patients with 
high diabetes literacy are 1.85 times more likely to achieve target glycemic 
control than lower diabetic literacy patients with 95% CI Adjusted Odds Ratio 
(AOR). 1.85(1.09-3.40). While patients with good adherence 1.61 times more 
likely to achieve target glycemic control than patients with low adherence; 95% 
CI AOR 1.61(1.04-4.79). Diabetic patients with morbidity have 67% less 
likelihood to achieve the target glycemic control; 95% CI AOR 0.33(0.15-0.73).
CONCLUSION: Adequate diabetic health literacy and better glycemic control are 
highly correlated. Adjusting all variables; younger age, high diabetic health 
literacy and good adherence are associated with achieving the target glycemic 
control.

BACK GROUND: Diabetes is increasing at an alarming rate throughout the world and 
about 80% of diabetic cases live in low and middle income countries. Glycemic 
control is the most important predictor for diabetic related complications and 
deaths. Identifying factors associated with glycemic control help health care 
providers and patients to work in the areas that reduce risks of diabetic 
related complications and deaths.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to assess the magnitude and factors 
associated with glycemic control among type 2 diabetic patients at Tikur Anbessa 
Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
METHODS: Hospital-based cross sectional study was conducted on 412 type 2 
diabetic patients who were attending in diabetic clinics at Tikur Anbessa 
Specialized Hospital. Data were collected through structured interview 
questionnaire, and data abstraction format to collect information from each 
patient's medical records from March to April, 2015. Data were entered and 
analyzed using SPSS version 20 statistical software. Both descriptive and 
inferential statistics were used to determine magnitude of glycemic control and 
factors associated with poor glycemic control.
RESULT: Median age of participants was 52 years old (IQR = 40-60 years old). 
From the study participants,51.7% were females. Median duration of living with 
diabetes since diagnosis was 10 years (IQR: 5-16 years). About 80% of the 
respondents had uncontrolled fasting blood glucose level. The factors which are 
significantly associated with poor glycemic control were longer duration of 
diabetes (AOR = 2.72 95%CI:1.16-6.32), and being on insulin therapy (AOR = 3.01 
95% CI: 1.5-5.9).
CONCLUSION: A high proportion of patients had poor glycemic control. Longer 
duration of the disease, and being on drug regimen of insulin were associated 
with poor glycemic control. Appropriate attention should be given to patients 
with longer duration of disease and those who are on insulin therapy.

BACKGROUND: The burden of diabetes in Ethiopia is exponentially increasing with 
more than 68% of people with it being undiagnosed and a death rate of 32%. It is 
a disease impacting patients with negative somatic, psychological, social, and 
economic consequences. Patients in Ethiopia have very low awareness about 
chronic complications, which is very worrying. The study aimed to explore the 
consequences of their disease experienced by type 2 diabetes patients in 
North-East Ethiopia.
METHODS: The study employed a phenomenological approach informed by the 
consequences dimension of the Common-Sense Model. It was conducted from July 
2019 to January 2020 using purposive sampling with face-to-face in-depth 
interviews, for about three weeks, until reaching theoretical saturation. The 
data were collected from twenty-four type 2 diabetes patients, who were selected 
to include various socio-demographic characteristics. The data were organized by 
QDA Miner Lite v2.0.8 and analyzed thematically using narrative strategies.
RESULTS: Using Common-Sense Model as a framework, the diabetes consequences 
experienced by the participants were categorized as complications and impacts. 
While the most common complications were cardiovascular disorders (hypertension, 
erectile dysfunction, heart and kidney problems, hyperlipidemia, edema, stroke, 
and fatigue) and ocular problems; the most common impacts were psychosocial 
(dread in life, suffering, family disruption, hopelessness, dependency, and 
craving), and economic (incapability and loss of productivity) problems.
CONCLUSION: The patients here were bothered by diabetes complications as well as 
its psycho-social, economic and somatic consequences; being the psycho-social 
impacts the most common. As a result, the patients have been suffering in the 
dread of "what can come next?" This dictates that holistic care, based on 
Common-Sense Model, is needed in providing special emphasis to psycho-social 
issues.

BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of risk factors that is responsible 
for the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Therefore, the aim of this 
study was to assess the prevalence of MetS and its components among T2DM 
patients.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Diabetes Clinic of the 
Hospital, from June to July, 2015. Data were entered into EPI INFO software and 
exported to SPSS 20 for analysis. MetS prevalence was estimated using NCEP 
ATPIII and IDF criteria. Anthropometric measurements, investigations of serum 
glucose and lipid profiles were done. Logistic regression analysis was used to 
evaluate associated factors. A P-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant.
RESULT: A total of 159 participants were included in the study; 119 (59.7%) were 
females with mean (±SD) age of (49.8±8.7) year. The prevalence of MetS was 66.7% 
in NCEP-ATP III and 53.5% in IDF definitions. The most prevalent component of 
MetS was elevated triglyceride (56.6% in ATPIII and 62.3% in IDF criteria), 
followed by abdominal obesity (61%) IDF and elevated blood pressure (55.4%) 
NCEP-ATPIII criteria. The regression analysis showed that increased age, being 
female, high BMI, having diabetes for over 5 years and poor glycemic control 
were significantly associated with metabolic syndrome.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of MetS and its components among T2DM patients were 
high, suggesting that diabetic patients are at increased risk of CVD and other 
complications. Efforts should be geared towards addressing these abnormalities 
through lifestyle modification, health awareness and medications in order to 
reduce this complication.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess magnitude of metabolic 
syndrome and its associated factors among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in 
Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. A hospital based cross sectional study 
design was used. Binary logistic regression model was used.
RESULT: A total of 419 respondents (208 males and 211 females) were enrolled; 
the mean age was 56.39 (SD 10.18), 51.1% of the respondents had metabolic 
syndrome according to international diabetes federation. Sex and age were 
statistically associated with metabolic syndrome with [AOR (95% CI) 1.93 (1.057, 
3.533) and 1.04 (1.012, 1.072)] respectively. Regular physical exercise, 
overweight and obesity were statistically associated with metabolic syndrome 
with [AOR (95% CI) 1.84 (1.002, 3.362), 2.68 (1.518, 4.747) and 3.55 (1.254, 
10.074)] respectively. To conclude, Magnitude of metabolic syndrome was high. 
The associated factors for metabolic syndrome are physical inactivity, 
inadequate intake of fruits, family history, overweight, and obesity.

OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to determine the level of glycaemic control and 
associated factors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treated with 
insulin-based therapy.
DESIGNS: Institutional-based multicentre cross-sectional study design was 
employed to conduct this study.
SETTINGS: The diabetes follow-up clinics of selected hospitals in Northwest 
Ethiopia.
PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with T2DM treated with insulin-based therapy at the 
selected hospitals who met the eligibility criteria were the study participants.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Good glycaemic control; when fasting blood glucose (FBG) 
level ranged from 70 to 130 mg/dL, and FBG <70 and >130 mg/dL was considered 
poor glycaemic control. A logistic regression model was used to identify 
determinants of poor glycaemic control. A p<0.05 at 95% CI was statistically 
significant.
RESULTS: Of 403 study participants, 54.8% were males with a mean age of 
55.03±10.8 years. Though patients with T2DM were treated with insulin-based 
therapy, most of the participants (72.5%) could not achieve the target FBG. The 
overall mean FBG was 177.1±54.3, and far from the target glucose level. Patients 
who could not practise self-monitoring of blood glucose were found more likely 
to have poor glycaemic control compared with those who practised self-monitoring 
(p<0.001). Whereas patients who had a normal body mass index (p=0.011) and who 
were treated with premixed insulin-based therapy (p=0.04) were found less likely 
to have poor glycaemic control compared with patients with obesity and who 
received NPH insulin based-regimens, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that a significant proportion of the study 
samples could not achieve glycaemic targets and the average blood glucose was 
far higher than the recommended glycaemic target level. Insulin initiation and 
titration, considering the determinants of glycaemic control, could be 
recommended to achieve target glycaemic levels.

BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of the most dangerous heart attack 
risk factors such as diabetes and prediabetes, abdominal obesity, high 
cholesterol and high blood pressure. Hyperuricemia is a condition in which the 
serum uric acid concentration is greater than 5.5 mg per deciliter for child and 
greater than 7.2 and 6.0 mg per deciliters for male and female adults 
respectively.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the magnitude of 
hyperuricemia and associated factors among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients at 
Hawassa Comprehensive Specialized Hospital (HCSH) from February 28 to May 30 
/2017. A random sampling technique was used to include 319 study subjects and a 
signed consent had been provided by each study subject before running any data 
collection. An interviewer administered structured questionnaire was used to 
collect socio-demographic and some clinically useful data. In addition to this, 
we reviewed the records of the study subjects to obtain other useful clinical 
data. Five milliliter blood specimen was collected from each study subjects 
after overnight fasting. A25TM Bio-System Random Access chemistry analyzer was 
used for blood sample analysis. All data were checked visually, coded and 
entered into epi-data version 3.4 and statistical analysis was performed using 
SPSS version 20.0 software. Bi-variate and multivariate logistic regressions 
were used to determine the association between explanatory and the outcome 
variables.
RESULTS: The prevalence of hyperuricemia and metabolic syndrome among type 2 
diabetic patients in the study area were 33.8%(n = 106) and 70.1% (n = 220) 
respectively. Having age greater or equal to 45 years (AOR: 1.9, CI: 1.-3.2, P 
value =0.015) and having metabolic syndrome (AOR: 2.6, CI: 1.5-4.7, P 
value = 0.001) were the determinant variables for hyperuricemia among type 2 
diabetic patients.
CONCLUSION: There was high prevalence of hyperuricemia among type 2 diabetic 
patients with high prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Therefore, regular health 
information about life style modification, early diagnosis and treatment for 
hyperuricemia and metabolic syndrome are essential to reduce hyperuricemia and 
metabolic syndrome in type 2 diabetic patients.

BACKGROUND: Diet is central to the management of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM). Depending on the stage of the disease at which the recommended 
diet is initiated, optimal adherence can reduce HbA1c by about 1 to 2%. However, 
evidence on eating behavior is generally scarce including in Ethiopia. The 
present study aimed to assess the eating behavior of adults with T2DM in North 
Ethiopia.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 421 adults with T2DM 
from September to November 2019. Socio-demographic variables were collected 
using structured questionnaires; an asset-based wealth index was used to 
determine socioeconomic status. Three dimensions of eating behavior were 
assessed using Likert-type items: food selection, meal planning and calorie 
recognition. Raw Likert scores in each dimension were transformed to percent 
scales to maximum (%SM). Participants' behavior in each dimension was 
categorized into healthy and unhealthy taking 66.7% SM score as a cutoff. 
Overall eating behavior was determined by aggregating ranks scored in the three 
dimensions. Correlates of overall eating behavior were identified using 
Chi-square test and multinomial logistic regression with statistical 
significance set at P-value < 0.05.
RESULT: Only 1% of the participants had overall healthy eating behavior. Yet, 
overall unhealthy eating was apparent in 54.4%. By dimensions, healthy eating 
behaviors in food selection, meal planning and calorie recognition were seen in 
43.5, 7.4 and 2.9% participants, respectively. Factors that were positively 
associated with having healthy eating behavior in one dimension relative to 
unhealthy in all were: receiving nutrition education [AOR 1.73; CI 1.09, 2.74], 
female gender [AOR 1.78; CI 1.03, 3.08] & being in 26-44 age category [AOR 3.7; 
CI 1.56, 8.85]. But, being in the poor [AOR 0.42; CI 0.16, 1.32] or average [AOR 
0.54; CI 0.19, 1.55] socioeconomic strata were negatively associated. However, 
only receiving nutrition education [AOR 3.65; CI 1.31, 10.18] was significantly 
associated with having healthy behavior in two eating dimensions over unhealthy 
in all.
CONCLUSION: In North Ethiopia, the overall eating behavior of adults with T2DM 
is extremely poor. Diverse and integrated approaches including nutrition 
education during consultation should be implemented to address the gap.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of T2DM in Ethiopia is on the rise according to 
certain studies. Appropriate management approaches are required to achieve 
desired goals of therapy in the clinical setup. This study was conducted to 
assess the treatment pattern and the factors associated with BP and FPG control 
among patients with T2DM in Federal Police Referral Hospital.
METHOD: An institution based cross sectional study was conducted from 15th 
October 2016 to 15th January 2017. A Systematic random sampling technique was 
employed in selecting the study participants. Data was collected using 
semi-structured interview and visiting medication records. SPSS version 20 was 
used for data analysis.
RESULTS: Out of a total of 414 participants who fulfilled the inclusion 
criteria, 361 were successfully interviewed and considered for further analysis. 
Target BP level was achieved in 206(57.1%) of the patients, whereas the 
proportion of hypertensive diabetics who attained the recommended BP target was 
19.4% (n=40). Of the 361 participants who were checked about their current FPG 
level, only 142(39.3%) were found to be <130mg/dl. However, 87(24.1%) 
participants were found to control both BP and FPG levels. Gender, military 
status, comorbidity, type of therapy and dietary adherence showed a 
statistically significant association with outcome variables.
CONCLUSION: The proportion of participants with T2DM who achieved target BP, FPG 
or both was suboptimal. A comprehensive approach that involves targeted 
education on self-management strategies, individualized treatment plans, and 
continuous evaluation of treatment outcomes should be practiced.

AIM: To estimate time to first optimal glycaemic control and identify prognostic 
factors among type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients attending diabetes clinic 
of public teaching hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review study was conducted at diabetes clinic of 
Addis Ababa's public teaching hospitals among a randomly selected sample of 685 
charts of patients with T2DMwho were on follow up from January 1, 2013 to June 
30, 2017. Data was collected using data abstraction tool. Descriptive 
statistics, Kaplan Meier plots, median survival time, Log-rank test and Cox 
proportional hazard survival models were used for analysis.
RESULTS: Median time to first optimal glycaemic control among the study 
population was 9.5 months. Factors that affect time to first optimal glycaemic 
control were age group (HR = 0.635, 95% CI: 0.486-0.831 for 50-59 years, HR = 
0.558, 95% CI: 0.403-0.771for 60-69 years and HR = 0.495, 95% CI: 0.310-0.790 
for > = 70 years), diabetes neuropathy (HR = 0.502, 95% CI: 0.375-0.672), more 
than one complication (HR = 0.381, 95% CI: 0.177-0.816), hypertension (HR = 
0.611, 95% CI: 0.486-0.769), dyslipidemia (HR = 0.609, 95% CI: 0.450-0.824), 
cardiovascular disease (HR = 0.670, 95% CI: 0.458-0.979) and hospital patient 
being treated (HR = 1.273, 95% CI: 1.052-1.541).
CONCLUSIONS: Median time to first optimal glycaemic control among T2DM patients 
is longer than expected which might imply that patients are being exposed to 
more risk of complication and death.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease associated with 
worse clinical presentation. However, the current investigation practices in 
Ethiopia have limitations to demonstrate the scope of the clinical burden. 
Hence, this study was aimed at assessing the glycemic status and coronary heart 
disease (CHD) risk of persons with T2DM using HbA1c and atherogenic index of 
plasma (AIP).
METHOD: This institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 421 
adults with T2DM from September to November 2019. Demographic, socioeconomic, 
and lifestyle data were collected through a face-to-face interview. Clinical 
information was retrieved from medical records whereas anthropometric and 
biochemical measurements were performed using the WHO protocols. Glycemic status 
was determined using HbA1c and CHD risk assessed using an atherogenic index of 
plasma (AIP). Gaussian variables were expressed using mean and standard 
deviation (SD), Log-normal variables using geometric mean and 95% CI and non- 
Gaussian variables using median and interquartile ranges. Categorical variables 
were summarized using absolute frequencies and percentages. Multivariable 
logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with glycemic 
control with a statistical significance set at 5%.
RESULT: A total of 195 male and 226 female subjects were involved in this study. 
The results demonstrated that 77% (324) had HbA1c value ≥7% and 87.2% (367) had 
high atherogenic risk for CHD. Besides, 57% and 67.9% of persons with T2DM had 
metabolic syndrome according to International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the 
National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult treatment panel III (NCEP-ATP III) 
criteria, respectively. About 36.8% had one or more comorbidities. Having 
healthy eating behavior [AOR 1.95; CI 1.11-3.43] and taking metformin [AOR 4.88; 
CI 1.91-12.44] were associated with better glycemic outcomes.
CONCLUSION: High AIP level concomitant with poor glycemic control indicates 
increased risk for coronary heart disease among persons with T2DM in Northern 
Ethiopia.

BACKGROUND: A comprehensive cardiovascular risk control reduces 
diabetes-associated complications but achieving the triplet goals (blood 
glucose, blood pressure (BP), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C)) remains a 
clinical challenge. Patients' knowledge of these diabetes therapeutic goals has 
been shown to improve glycemic control. However, this is not well studied in 
Ethiopia.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from March to June 2020 in Tikur 
Anbessa Specialized Hospital among randomly selected 419 patients with type 2 
diabetes. Data was collected using a pretested, structured questionnaire. A 
multivariable binary logistic regression was fitted to identify determinants of 
knowledge.
RESULTS: The mean age (±SD) of study participants was 57.4 (±10.8) years and the 
median duration (IQR) of diabetes was 12 (7, 20) years. A quarter of them 
achieved fasting glycemic control, a fifth of them attained the A1c goal and 
only 3% achieved the triple targets. Patients who reported knowing their target 
goals for BP, fasting blood sugar (FBS), A1C, and LDL-C were 79.5, 77.3, 11.7, 
and 7.2% respectively. The factors associated with knowledge of the therapeutic 
goals were longer diabetes duration, increased household income, age, being 
divorced as compared to married, having no formal education, and primary 
education.
CONCLUSION: The majority of participants knew their BP and FBS targets while 
only a minority understood their A1c and LDL-C targets. It highlighted the need 
for the provision of patient-centered diabetes education to improve knowledge of 
the therapeutic targets.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its treatment impact patients' 
physical health as well as emotional and social wellbeing. This study aimed to 
assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and associated factors among 
patients with T2DM at a tertiary care hospital in Ethiopia.
METHODS: A face-to-face cross-sectional survey was conducted among patients with 
T2DM at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We 
collected data using a validated Amharic version of the 5-level EuroQoL-5 
dimensions (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to present 
patient characteristics. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were performed 
to explore differences in the median scores of EQ-5D-5L utility and visual 
analog scale (EQ-VAS). Multivariable Tobit regression models were used to 
identify predictors of HRQoL. Utility scores were calculated using disutility 
weights of the Ethiopian general population. Statistical significance was 
determined at p < 0.05.
RESULTS: A total of 360 patients with T2DM participated. Mean (SD) age was 
64.43(10.61) years. Reported health problems were mostly in the pain/discomfort 
(67.3%) dimension followed by mobility (60.5%), whereas the usual activities 
domain (34.1%) was the least health problem being reported. The median (IQR) 
EQ-5D-5L utility and EQ-VAS scores were 0.95 (0.88-0.96) and 80 (75.0-85.0), 
respectively. In multivariable Tobit regression models older age, having poor 
glycemic control, longer duration of diabetes, insulin usage, obesity, and 
having diabetes-related complications were significant negative predictors of 
HRQoL.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, patients with T2DM had lower HRQoL than the general 
population, which was attributed to being older age, longer duration of 
diabetes, insulin use, obesity, inadequate glycemic control, and 
diabetes-related complications. The utility index we generated can be used in 
future economic evaluations to inform decisions about alternative interventions 
and resource allocation.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is the most common health problem globally. 
Depression and anxiety can exacerbate disease complications, make patients 
suffer more, and increase healthcare costs. Even though, depression and anxiety 
are common among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, there have been limited 
studies conducted about the determinants of depression and anxiety in Ethiopia. 
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the magnitude and 
determinants of depression and anxiety symptoms among Type 2 diabetes mellitus 
patients, attending out-patient treatment at Harari regional state government 
hospitals, Eastern Ethiopia.
METHOD: An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted from March to 
April at Harari regional state government hospitals in eastern Ethiopia. A total 
of 421 participants were recruited using the systematic sampling technique. Data 
was collected by using Afan Oromo version of interviewer-administered structured 
and semi-structured questionnaires. Depression and Anxiety symptoms were 
assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Bivariate and 
multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to identify variables related 
to both depression and anxiety symptoms. The association was described using an 
adjusted odds ratio and a 95% confidence interval (CI), with P-values of 0.05 
used as a cutoff for a significant association in the adjusted analysis.
RESULT: Out of the 416 participants included in this study, 42.3%, 40.4% had 
depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Being female (Adjusted Odds 
Ratio = 1.85(1.09-3.15)), no formal education (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 2.65, 
(1.04-6.73)), age ≥ 70 (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 2.88 (1.28-6.48)), family history 
of mental illness (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 1.71 (1.35-3.82)) and poor social 
support (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 2.35(1.12-6.03)) were statistically associated 
with depression. While having a family history of mental illness (AOR 
1.74(1.03-2.95)), being widowed (AOR = 3.45(1.49-8.01)), and having poor social 
support (AOR = 2.15(1.12, 4.89)) were statistically significant associated with 
anxiety at a p-value < 0.05.
CONCLUSION: Current study results showed that the magnitude of depression and 
anxiety were relatively high among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.Having a 
family history of mental illness and poor social support were statistically 
associated with both depression and anxiety symptoms. Screening, early 
detection, and appropriate treatment of depression and anxiety symptoms in type 
2 diabetes mellitus patients should be prioritized by health care providers.

PURPOSE: Proactive management of type 2 diabetes is important for restoring 
beta-cell function and improving sustained blood glucose control. Evidence on 
quality of diabetes care in Ethiopia is inadequate.
METHOD: Facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted to assess level of 
quality of care provided to adult type 2 diabetes patients at three public 
hospitals in Gamo Gofa Zone, Southern Ethiopia.
RESULTS: A total of 210 adult type 2 diabetes patients were included. The mean 
age of patients was 44.1 ± 9.94 years. Fifty-one (24.3%) of patients adhered to 
prescribed medicines. Sixty-seven (31.9%) patients could benefit from neuropathy 
screening and referral. Diabetes-specific evidence-based guidelines, operational 
plan to reduce overweight and obesity were not available. There was no periodic 
lipid profile, renal function and glycated haemoglobin testing. Sixty-three 
(30%) patients achieved fasting blood glucose (FBG) level. Only 41 (19.5%) 
achieved the recommended target value for composite intermediate outcomes. All 
three sub-components of quality care structure, process and outcome (SPO) were 
below the agreed minimum score and the quality of care provided to adult type 2 
diabetes was poor. Only 41 (19.5%) achieved agreed quality indicator targets for 
type 2 diabetes (fasting blood glucose blood pressure and low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol).
CONCLUSION: The quality of care provided to adult type 2 diabetes patients was 
poor particularly in areas such as availability of evidence-based guidelines, 
operational plan to reduce obesity, monitoring of lipid profile and glycaemic 
control. Therefore, developing strategies for addressing structure, process and 
outcome-related gaps by involving all stakeholders is critical for improving the 
quality of care provided to these patients.

PURPOSE: To assess the health-related quality of life and associated factors 
among type 2 diabetic patients in Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, 
Northern Ethiopia, 2019.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 
415 type 2 diabetic patients coming to receive their routine outpatient 
follow-up service during the study period, from January 1, 2019, to March 31, 
2019, in Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northern Ethiopia. The 
EQ-5D-3L instrument was used to assess the patients' self-reported health status 
and a multivariable ordinal logistic regression model was used to determine the 
independent factors associated with the health-related quality of life and 
P-value <0.05 was used to declare statistical significance.
RESULTS: The total mean quality of life score was 0.73 ± 0.23 with the total 
quality-adjusted life year of 2172.60 per life years and an average of 7.4 years 
of follow-up with type 2 diabetic treatments. Quality of life of type 2 diabetic 
patients with level two and three anxious patients were 77% and almost three 
times more likely to be affected than level one anxious patients (AOR = 1.77; 
95% CI 1.23-1.86) and (AOR = 2.74; 95% CI 1.24-2.84) respectively. Older age, 
occupational status, lower monthly income, long waiting time, and presence of 
diabetic complications were significantly associated with impaired 
health-related quality of life.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study revealed a relatively low health status 
among type 2 diabetic patients. Quality of life of type 2 diabetic patients was 
mostly affected in the anxiety and depression component. It could be worthwhile 
if hospitals assign psychiatric professionals for the regular and effective 
counseling of diabetic patients.

PURPOSE: Diabetes patients must be equipped with the necessary knowledge to 
confidently undertake appropriate self-care activities. We prepared a diabetes 
self-management education (DSME) intervention and assessed how it affected 
patients' self-reported levels of diabetes knowledge, self-care behaviors, and 
self-efficacy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A before-and-after, two-group intervention study was 
conducted at Jimma University Medical Centre among adult patients with type 2 
diabetes. At baseline, we randomly assigned 116 participants to the DSME 
intervention and 104 to a comparison group. Six interactive DSME sessions 
supported by an illustrative handbook and fliers, experience-sharing, and 
take-home activities were administered to the intervention group by two nurses 
during a six-month period. Diabetes knowledge, self-care behaviors, and 
self-efficacy were measured at baseline and at nine months following the 
commencement of DSME intervention (endpoint) in both groups.
RESULTS: At the endpoint, data from 78 intervention group participants and 64 
comparison group participants were included in final analysis. The difference in 
the mean Diabetes Knowledge Scale scores before and after the DSME intervention 
was significantly greater in the intervention group (p = 0.044). The measured 
self-care behaviors included diet, exercise, glucose self-monitoring, footcare, 
smoking, alcohol consumption, and khat chewing. The mean number of days per week 
on which the intervention group participants followed general dietary 
recommendations increased significantly at the endpoint (p = 0.027). The 
intervention group followed specific dietary recommendations (p = 0.019) and 
performed footcare (p = 0.009) for a significantly greater number of days. There 
were no significant differences within or between the groups in other 
self-reported diabetes self-care behavior regimens or in diabetes self-efficacy.
CONCLUSION: Our study found significant improvements in the intervention 
participants' diabetes knowledge scores and in their adherence to dietary and 
footcare recommendations. This demonstrates that our DSME intervention may be of 
clinical importance in developing countries such as Ethiopia.

INTRODUCTION: Even though optimal blood glucose control reduces the risk of 
diabetes-related complications, many patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) fail to 
achieve it for a variety of reasons. In the study area, there was a paucity of 
evidence regarding correlates of glycemic control. Therefore, this study aimed 
to find out the correlates of glycemic control among patients with T2D in 
Eastern Ethiopia.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 879 adult patients with T2D 
on follow-up at two public hospitals in Harar. Data were collected through 
interviews, physical measurements, and record reviews. The level of glycemic 
control was determined from three consecutive fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 
measurements. A mean value of FPG measurements falling in the normal range 
(80-130 mg/dl) was considered as optimal glycemic control; otherwise, a mean FPG 
level that is below or above the normal range (<80 mg/dl or >130 mg/dl) was 
defined as suboptimal glycemic control. Descriptive statistics were used to 
summarize the data, while a linear regression model was used to find out the 
correlates of glycemic control. A beta coefficient and a 95% CI reported 
associations. The statistical significance was declared at a p-value ≤0.05.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients with T2D was 52.7 ( ± 13.3) years. The 
mean FPG level was 172 ± 56 mg/dl. Suboptimal glycemic control was found in 76% 
(95% CI: 73.41, 79.04) of patients with T2D. In a multivariable linear 
regression, khat chewing (β = 6.12; 95% CI: 1.55, 8.69), triglycerides (β = 
0.56; 95% CI: 0.41.48, 0.65), comorbidity (β = 5.29; 95% CI: 1.39, 9.13), and 
poor level of self-care practices (β = 5.43; 95% CI: 1.41, 6.46) showed a 
significant correlation with glycemic control.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found that about three-fourths of patients with T2D had 
suboptimal glycemic control. Khat chewing, comorbidity, and poor level of 
self-care practices were independently correlated with glycemic control. Thus, 
suppressing glycemic levels through appropriate treatment and strict diabetes 
self-care practices including avoidance of Khat chewing is a useful approach to 
attaining glycemic target that subsequently reduces cardiovascular risks.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is (DM) a global public health problem and a 
complex disease characterized by chronic hyperglycemia that leads to long-term 
macrovascular and microvascular complications. Recent studies have reported the 
role of hematological indices in contributing to the vascular injury in diabetic 
patients. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine hematological indices and 
their correlation with fasting blood glucose level and anthropometric 
measurement in type 2 DM patients in comparison with healthy controls.
METHODS: A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted at the chronic 
illness clinic of Gondar University Hospital from February to April 2015. A 
total of 296 participants (148 cases and 148 healthy controls) were selected 
using systematic random sampling technique. Data were collected using a 
pretested structured questionnaire. Fasting blood glucose levels and 
hematological indices were determined by using Bio Systems A25 and Sysmex-KX 21N 
analyzers, respectively. Independent sample t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and 
correlation statistics were used. A P-value <0.05 was considered as 
statistically significant.
RESULT: There was significant difference in red blood cell distribution width 
(47.3±2.6 fL vs 45.2±3 fL) between diabetic patients and controls. Total white 
blood cells in 10(3)/µL (6.59±1.42 vs 5.56±1.38), absolute lymphocyte count in 
10(3)/µL (2.60±0.70 vs 2.04±0.63), and absolute neutrophil count in 10(3)/µL 
(3.57±1.46 vs 3.11±1.04) increased significantly in diabetic patients compared 
with controls, respectively. Among platelet indices, mean platelet volume 
(10.4±1.1 fL vs 9.9±1.1 fL) and platelet distribution width (14.5±2.1 fL vs 13.4 
±2.1 fL) were found to be significantly increased in the diabetic patients 
(P<0.05). Anthropometric measurements significantly correlated with white blood 
cell and platelet indices.
CONCLUSION: The study showed statistically significant difference in some 
hematological parameters of diabetic patients compared to controls. Thus, 
hematological indices could be useful indicators of vascular complication and 
glycemic control in type 2 DM patients.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the incidence of chronic kidney disease 
and its predictors among newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients attending St. 
Paul's Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
RESULTS: The overall incidence of chronic kidney disease was a major public 
health issue among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with 2178 (95% CI 12,801, 
21,286) cases per 10,000 patient-months. Moreover, 62(14.25%) patients in the 
sample experienced chronic kidney disease. Old age [adjusted hazard ratio 
(AHR) = 1.06, 95%CI 1.03, 1.09], no diabetic retinopathy [AHR = 0.13, 95%CI 
0.07-0.24], high density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥ 40 mg/dl [AHR = 0.55, 95%CI 
0.31, 0.97] and high body mass index [AHR = 1.17, 95%CI 1.1, 1.25] were common 
factors for chronic kidney diseases.

BACKGROUND: Psychological disorders are common among individuals with type 2 
diabetes mellitus. The effect of exercise training on psychological disorders 
like anxiety and depression has not been well studied in Ethiopia. The objective 
of this study was to assess the effect of structured aerobic and resistance 
exercises on psychological domains among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus in 
southern Ethiopia.
METHOD: We began by approaching 97 type 2 diabetic patients who regularly attend 
follow-up clinics. The 24 study participants were randomly assigned to one of 
four groups: aerobic exercise (n = 6), resistance exercise (n = 6), combined 
aerobic and resistance exercise (n = 6), and control group (n = 6). For each 
arm, the interventions were a structured workout package that was completed 
without interrupting usual clinical follow-up. The control groups, on the other 
hand, were kept as follow-up clinical cases with daily routine work. A paired 
t-test was performed to compare the means and mean differences of each exercise 
group's pretest and posttest. A Tukey's post hoc test was performed to compare 
mean differences between groups. The significance level was set at P < 0.05.
RESULT: A more significant change was obtained in the combined aerobic and 
resistance exercise on anxiety and depression (p = 0.006), social dysfunction 
(p = 0.009), loss of confidence (p = 0.012) in particular, and psychological 
wellbeing (p = 0.010) in general. Resistance exercise alone had a significant 
impact on social dysfunction (p = 0.010), anxiety and depression (p = 0.017), 
and psychological well-being (p = 0.012) in general. Changes in social 
dysfunction (p = 0.010), anxiety and depression (p = 0.030), and psychological 
well-being (p = 0.018) were also influenced by aerobic exercise. The study found 
no significant change in depression and anxiety among control groups.
CONCLUSION: As a result, the combined effect of aerobic and resistance exercise 
had a greater influence on improving anxiety and depression, social dysfunction, 
loss of confidence in particular, and psychological well-being in general among 
patients with type 2 diabetes. In other words, the present evidence proves the 
betterment of combined aerobic and resistance exercises alone followed by 
resistance exercise alone and aerobic exercise alone compared with non-exercise 
groups seems to upgrade psychological wellbeing by setting up three main 
benefits named as: (1) anti-anxiety and depression effects; (2) anti-social 
dysfunction effects; and (3) anti-loss of confidence effects. This suggests that 
patients with diabetes who exercise regularly enhance their psychological 
well-being.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the level of diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetes 
(T2DM) patients attending the University of Gondar Hospital (UGH) Diabetic 
Clinic, Northwest Ethiopia.
METHODS: An audit was carried out involving a total of 739 T2DM patients 
attending at the diabetic clinic of UGH. They represented approximately 90% and 
50% of all T2DM patients under regular review at the urban and rural diabetic 
clinics of UGH, respectively. All were supervised by the same clinical team for 
a long period. Eye examinations were performed for visual acuity, cataract, and 
retinal changes (retinal photography and slit-lamp biomicroscopy). Body mass 
index (BMI) and HbA1c levels were measured. The presence or absence of 
hypertension was recorded.
RESULTS: Men constituted 41.5% of the group, the mean age at diagnosis of T2DM 
was 50.4 years, and 50.2% were hypertensive. The BMI was 25.0 ± 4.1 kg/m2, and 
HbA1c was 7.75 ± 1.63% (61.2 ± 17.8 mmol/mol) (mean ± SD, for BMI and HbA1c)). 
Severe visual impairment/blindness was reported in 10.6%, 15.2% had cataract, 
16.0% had retinopathy, and 11.1% had maculopathy. The prevalence of retinopathy 
increased with time from diagnosis of T2DM (chi-square for trend, p < 0.001) and 
with increasing HbA1c level (chi-square for trend, p=0.03).
CONCLUSION: These results compare well with the most recent results in 
well-equipped, wealthier regions of the world and show the importance of stable 
healthcare infrastructure for chronic-disease management.

Health and Primary Care, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.

Background. Metformin is a widely accepted first-line pharmacotherapy for 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Treatment of T2DM with 
glibenclamide, saxagliptin, or one of the other second-line treatment agents is 
recommended when the first-line treatment (metformin) cannot control the 
disease. However, there is little evidence on the additional cost and 
cost-effectiveness of adding second-line drugs. Therefore, this study aimed to 
estimate the cost-effectiveness of saxagliptin and glibenclamide as second-line 
therapies added to metformin compared with metformin only in T2DM in Ethiopia. 
Methods. This cost-effectiveness study was conducted in Ethiopia using a mix of 
primary data on cost and best available data from the literature on the 
effectiveness. We measured the interventions' cost from the providers' 
perspective in 2019 US dollars. We developed a Markov model for T2DM disease 
progression with five health states using TreeAge Pro 2020 software. 
Disability-adjusted life year (DALY) was the health outcome used in this study, 
and we calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per DALY 
averted. Furthermore, one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were 
performed. Results. The annual unit cost per patient was US$70 for metformin, 
US$75 for metformin + glibenclamide, and US$309 for metformin + saxagliptin. The 
ICER for saxagliptin + metformin was US$2259 per DALY averted. The ICER results 
were sensitive to various changes in cost, effectiveness, and transition 
probabilities. The ICER was driven primarily by the higher cost of saxagliptin 
relative to glibenclamide. Conclusion. Our study revealed that saxagliptin is 
not a cost-effective second-line therapy in patients with T2DM inadequately 
controlled by metformin monotherapy based on a gross domestic product per capita 
per DALY averted willingness-to-pay threshold in Ethiopia (US$953).

BACKGROUND: Stroke is a global public health concern with type 2 diabetes being 
one of the common risk factors. Knowledge of stroke risk factors and warning 
symptoms among type 2 diabetes patients is largely unknown in developing 
countries like Ethiopia. The inability to recognize stroke warning symptoms 
accurately is an important cause of delay in seeking medical attention. We 
investigated knowledge of stroke risk factors and warning symptoms among adults 
with type 2 diabetes and the factors associated with these variables.
METHODS: This was an institution-based cross-sectional study. We enrolled 470 
adult type 2 diabetes patients using a systematic random sampling method from 
four government-managed hospitals in Addis Ababa from 1 to 30 February 2021. The 
Stroke Recognition Questionnaire was adapted to measure the knowledge of stroke 
risk factors and warning symptoms. Sociodemographic characteristics, source of 
information, and reaction to stroke were also measured. Data were analyzed using 
SPSS version 25 and linear regression analysis was used to determine factors 
independently associated with knowledge of stroke risk factors and warning 
symptoms.
RESULT: The mean age of the participants was 50.6 ± 12.9 years. The mean score 
of knowledge of stroke risk factors and warning symptoms was 67.2% and 63.9%, 
respectively. Higher educational level (B = 2.007, 95% CI = 1.101, 2.914, 
P < 0.001), knowing someone diagnosed with stroke (B = 3.328, 95% CI = 2.734, 
3.922, P < 0.001), and living with others (B = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.606, 2.954, 
P < 0.001) were independently associated with knowledge of stroke risk factors. 
Younger age (B = - 0.021, 95% CI= -0.038, 0.005, P = 0.01), higher educational 
level (B = 1.873, 95% CI = 1.017, 2.730, P < 0.001), and knowing someone 
diagnosed with stroke (B = 3.64, 95% CI = 3.079, 4.200, P < 0.001) were 
independently associated with knowledge of warning symptoms of stroke.
CONCLUSION: The mean score of knowledge of stroke risk factors and warning 
symptoms was 67.2% and 63.9%, respectively. Younger age, higher educational 
level, and living with other people are predictors of better knowledge of stroke 
risk factors and warning symptoms in this study. Future educational 
interventions should target type 2 diabetes adults with advancing age and the 
involvement of their family members.

BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a complex disorder characterized by a 
cluster of interrelated cardiovascular risk factors. So far, cutoff point 
variability of waist circumference was documented to define MetS.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the classification power and cutoff point of waist 
circumference to define MetS among patients with type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: An institution-based cross sectional study was conducted from March to 
April 2017 at Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital among patients with type 
2 diabetes. Using systematic sampling technique, 520 participants were enrolled 
into the study. Data were collected by checklist, anthropometric measurements 
and biochemical analyses. Data were entered to Epi-info 3.5.1 and transferred to 
SPSS 20 for analysis. Participants having more than one abnormal MetS components 
were categorized as patients and the others were considered as control. The 
classification power of waist circumference to distinguish patients from 
controls was determined by ROC curve analysis. Waist circumference cutoff points 
were determined by taking the point that had a maximum youden index.
RESULTS: Among the 520 participants, 308 (59.2%) were females. The mean age of 
the participants was 56 ± 10.8 years for males and 55 ± 11.4 years for females. 
The classification power of waist circumference was 0.67 (0.58-0.75) for male 
and 0.63 (0.52-0.73) for females. The optimal waist circumference cutoff point 
to distinguish patients from controls were 95.5 cm (sensitivity 39.8%, 
specificity 86.3%, p< 0.001) for males, and 87.5 cm (sensitivity 73.1%, 
specificity 54.5%, p< 0.017) for females.
CONCLUSION: The positive predictive value of waist circumference was 93% for 
females and 90% for males in Northern Ethiopia using 87.5 and 95.5 cm points 
cut-off for females and males, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: Even though life-threatening complications in type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) minimize through self-care practice, extensive studies in 
northeast Ethiopia have been scarce about self-care practice and predictors. 
This study aimed to assess diabetes self-care predictors among patients with 
T2DM patients at Dubti and Assaita hospitals in northeastern Ethiopia.
METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 403 patients 
with T2DM who followed-up in northeastern Ethiopia's Dubti and Assaita 
hospitals. Data were analyzed using SPSS version-22.0 after the data were 
entered, sorted and cleaned. Multiple stepwise backward logistic regression 
analysis was done for a P value of <0.25 to identify the independent predictors 
of self-care practice.
RESULTS: In the present study, males comprised 62% of the sex category. Overall, 
63.8% of the study participants had adequate self-care practice, while 36.2% had 
inadequate self-care practice. Being younger age (AOR 2.27, 95% CI 1.27-4.07, P= 
0.005), monthly income status with low (AOR 3.08, 95% CI 1.08-8.78, P= 0.04), 
average (AOR 2.43, 95% CI 1.15-5.09, P= 0.02) and high (AOR 2.68, 95% CI 
1.03-6.99, P= 0.04), treated with oral hypoglycemic agents (OHA) (AOR 0.22, 95% 
CI 0.05-0.95, P = 0.04) and insulin (AOR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04-0.75, P= 0.01), 
having social support (AOR 3.09, 95% CI 1.76-5.4, P ≤ 0.01) and diabetic 
education from health professionals (AOR 5.53, 95% CI 1.92-15.93, P= 0.001) and 
media (AOR 2.63, 95% CI 1.47-4.7, P = 0.001) were the independent predictors of 
self-care practice.
CONCLUSION: In this study, the practice of self-care found to be sub-optimal 
among patients with T2DM. Independent predictors of self-care practice were age, 
monthly income, treatment regimen, social support, and diabetic education. 
Therefore, a suitable approach should be built to improve self-care practice 
with diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes, which is increasing as a public health problem in 
the low resource settings of Africa has been associated with the high prevalence 
of micro-vascular complications and increasing levels of macro-vascular 
complications. There is evidence from the developed world that understanding 
patient perceptions of chronic illness is important to design effective 
strategies for helping patients manage these conditions. This study utilized 
Kleinman's model to explore the illness perceptions of type 2 diabetes patients 
attending treatment in Addis Ababa and Butajira (Ethiopia) and better understand 
how they manage their illness.
DESIGN: Qualitative interviews were conducted to elicit the explanatory models 
of purposively sampled type 2 diabetes patients attending treatment in three 
hospitals in central Ethiopia until saturation of key emerging themes was 
achieved. Analysis of interview transcripts was guided by Kleinman's model.
RESULTS: A total of 39 participants, 24 from Addis Ababa and the rest from 
Butajira took part in the study. This study revealed that patients' explanatory 
models were informed by both the traditional and biomedical models with 
emotional distress evident in some of the participants. The traditional model 
seemed to reflect the strong religious and cultural influences for the majority 
of study participants. The findings also revealed that symptoms played 
significant roles in how patients viewed their illness including assessment of 
its severity. Most were uncertain about the cause of their illness, with those 
expressing certainty citing factors over which they believed they had little or 
no control. This may have contributed to the perceptions about the use of 
religious healing and traditional medicines in a complementary or alternative 
manner to the biomedical regimen which could affect their adherence to 
recommended regimens and their health outcomes.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests the need for a strong diabetes care program that 
is sensitive to patients' experiences of their illness including emotional 
distress. Individuals providing the diabetes care should consider local and 
individual contexts and strive to make their approach patient-centered and 
engage active participation of patients. There appears to be a need for better 
training of health providers in different areas including health communications 
and the fundamentals of mental healthcare.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the known cause of morbidity and 
mortality among diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. Targeted screening of renal 
impairment based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) among DM 
patients has potential benefits in early identification and treatment of CKD. 
Hence, this study was aimed to estimate the magnitude of renal impairment using 
eGFR among type 2 DM patients.
METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 
February-1 to April 30/2020 among 422 type 2 DM patients in Northeast Ethiopia. 
Data were collected by the semi-structured questioner and serum creatinine 
measurement. The collected data were edited into Epi-data manager version 
4.4.1.0, and the analysis was performed by SPSS-25. The Simplified Modification 
of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology (CKD-EPI), 
and Cockcroft-Gault (C-G) equations were used to calculate eGFR.
RESULTS: Of all study participants, 82(19.4%), 92(21.8%), and 103(24.4%) had 
eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, according to the MDRD, CKD-EPI, and C-G equations, 
respectively. Female sex, (MDRD:AOR = 4.44, 95%CI:1.97-9.97, CKD-EPI:AOR = 3.17, 
95%CI:1.27-6.17, and C-G:AOR = 2.65, 95%CI:1.35-5.21), duration ≥ 10 years 
(MDRD:AOR = 3.38, 95%CI:1.45-7.92, CKD-EPI:AOR = 3.09, 95%CI:1.07-7.77, and 
C-G:AOR = 2.92, 95%CI:1.29-6.61), age ˃60 years (MDRD:AOR = 2.29, 
95%CI:1.09-4.77, CKD-EPI:AOR = 4.12, 95%CI:1.68-6.78, and C-G: AOR = 3.42, 
95%CI:1.77-6.60), hypertension (MDRD:AOR = 3.12, 95%CI:1.51-6.45, CKD-EPI: 
AOR = 4.21,95%CI:2.07-7.98, and C-G:AOR = 3.99, 95%CI:2.08-7.65), poor glycemic 
control (MDRD:AOR = 2.82, 95%CI:1.13-7.05, and C-G:AOR = 2.34, 95%CI:1.09-5.04), 
and body mass index (MDRD:AOR = 1.11, 95%CI:1.01-1.22, and CKD-EPI:AOR = 2.43, 
95%CI:1.27-5.76) were significantly associated with renal impairment.
CONCLUSION: Renal impairment was prevalent among type 2 DM patients. Older age, 
female sex, duration, hypertension, poor glycemic control, and BMI were 
significantly associated with renal impairment.

BACKGROUND: Even though the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is swelling 
rapidly in Ethiopia, data regarding glycemic control, a key strategy for marked 
reduction of diabetes mellitus complications, is scant. We have assessed the 
status of glycemic control and its contributing factors among adult patients 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
METHODS: This was a facility based cross-sectional survey of 325 adults with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus attending in Jimma University Teaching Hospital, South 
west Ethiopia. Data from all the patients were collected between February and 
April 2014. Glycemic level was assessed by using fasting blood glucose level, 
and 'poor glycemic control' was defined when fasting blood glucose level was 
above 130 mg/dL (7 mm/L). Analysis included both descriptive and inferential 
statistics, and SPSS version 20.0 was used for all analysis.
RESULTS: 309 respondents were included in the survey. More than two-third 
(70.9 %) of the patients had poor blood glycemic control. Patients who were 
illiterate (AOR = 3.46, 95 % CI 1.01-11.91) and farmer (AOR = 2.47, 95 % CI 
1.13-5.39) had high odds of poor glycemic control. In addition, taking 
combination of insulin and oral medication (AOR = 4.59, 95 % CI 1.05-20.14) and 
poor medication adherence (AOR = 5.08 95 % CI 2.02-12.79) associated 
statistically with poor glycemic control.
CONCLUSION: Majority of patients had poor glycemic control. Patients with low 
level of education, being employed, on combinations of insulin and oral 
medication, and lower adherence to their medication were likely to have poor 
glycemic control. Education and awareness creation could be a cross cutting 
intervention for the significant factors.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a leading cause of morbidity 
and mortality in diabetic patients representing a huge health and economic 
burden. Despite the increasing number of patients with Diabetes Mellitus in 
Ethiopia, the incidence of diabetic nephropathy in patients with DM has not been 
well established. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the incidence and 
predictors of DN in patients with T2DM at tertiary healthcare setting, Ethiopia.
METHODS: An institution based retrospective follow study was conducted from 
March 1 to April 28, 2019. Kaplan-meier survival curve together with log rank 
test were used. Cox proportional hazard model was used at 5% level of 
significance to determine the net effect of each explanatory variable on 
diabetic nephropathy. An assumption was check by schoenfeld residual test.
RESULTS: The incidence rate of diabetic nephropathy was 3.6% per 100 
person-years (95% CI = 2.49-11.47). The median time to develop nephropathy was 
100(95% CI, 96.7-107) months. Predictors of diabetic nephropathy were males 
(AHR: 2.7, 95%CI: 1.39, 5.23), long duration of diabetes (AHR: 1.03, 95%CI: 
1.01, 1.06), HbA1c> 7% (AHR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.67, 3.12), high density lipoprotein 
(AHR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.83), and mixed anti-diabetic therapy (AHR: 0.07, 95% 
CI: 0.01, 0.59).
CONCLUSION: The incidence of diabetic nephropathy among T2DM patients was 
relatively high. Males, longer duration of diabetes, HbA1c, and fasting blood 
glucose were increase the risk of diabetic nephropathy.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess drug-related problems and its 
determinants in type 2 diabetes patients with hypertension co-morbidity.
RESULTS: A total of 300 type 2 diabetes patients with hypertension co-morbidity 
were studied. The majority of participants, 194 (64.7%), were males. Mean age of 
the participants was 54.44 ± 11.68 years. The mean durations of diabetes and 
hypertension were 5.37 ± 4.79 and 5.15 ± 4.65 years respectively. The most 
commonly prescribed antidiabetic medications were metformin in 200 (66.7%) and 
insulin 126 (42%) of the participants. Enalapril was the most commonly 
prescribed antihypertensive medication; 272 (90.7%). Aspirin was prescribed to 
182 (60.7%) participants. Statins were prescribed to one-third (65.67%) of the 
participants. Eighty-five (28.3%) participants had diabetes related 
complications other than hypertension. A total of 494 drug related problems were 
identified. The mean number of drug related problems was 1.65 ± 1.05. The most 
common drug related problems were need for additional drug therapy (29.35%), 
ineffective drug (27.94%) and dose too low (15.8%). Independent predictors of 
drug related problems were age 41-60 years (AOR = 6.87, 95% CI 2.63-17.93), 
age > 60 years (AOR = 5.85, 95% CI 2.15-15.93) and the presence of comorbidity 
(AOR = 3.0, 95% CI 1.11-8.16).

OBJECTIVE: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic non-communicable disease with 
considerable impact on health status and quality of life. It has a profound 
effect on quality of life in terms of social and psychological as well as 
physical well-being. This study was conducted to assess health related quality 
of life among patients with diagnosed type 2 diabetes.
RESULT: A cross-sectional study design was conducted from April to May, 2015. 
World Health Organization quality of life-BREF tool was used for collecting the 
data. A total of 344 patients with diagnosed type 2 diabetes were involved in 
the study. The overall health related quality of life mean score of the study 
participants was 52.6 ± 12.1 SD. Social domain has higher mean score 
(57.8 ± 14.8 SD). Educational status, marital status, occupation, duration of 
the diabetes and diabetes related complications had statistically significant 
association with health-related quality of life. An intervention that give 
special attention to the breaking of the cycle of low occupational status and 
literacy; and which encourage patients with type 2 DM to have good control of 
their diabetes and prevent complication should be implemented to improve their 
quality of life.

OBJECTIVE: Contemporary clinical guidelines endorsed that glycemic control is 
the ultimate goal in the management patients with diabetes. The aim of this 
study was to assess the prevalence of glycemic control and to identify 
predictors of poor glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). A 
cross-sectional study was conducted among systematically selected 357 diabetic 
patients. Data were collected through direct patients' interviews and medical 
chart review. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed and analyzed 
using SPSS version 22.0.
RESULTS: Participants' mean age was (± SD) 56.1 ± 11.6 years. Nearly four in 
five (77.9%) of the participants had comorbidities, mainly of hypertension, and 
60.2% had diabetic complications, mainly diabetes neuropathy. Poor glycemic 
control was found in 68.3% of the participants with a mean (± SD) FBG of 
174.1 ± 48.9 mg/dL. Being female gender, having greater body mass index and low 
medication adherence was significantly associated with poor glycemic control. In 
conclusion, the overall aspects of glycemic control level of patients were far 
from the standards. Being female, greater body mass index and poor medication 
adherence were predictors of poor glycemic control. In response to this finding, 
an aggressive intervention that targets in improving the glycemic control is 
required.

OBJECTIVE: Although most clinical practice guidelines endorsed statin use in 
type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients for reducing cardiovascular diseases (CVD), 
little is known about statin utilization in case of Ethiopia. Hence, this study 
was aimed to evaluate prescribing pattern of statins for primary prevention of 
CVD in T2D patients. A retrospective study conducted in T2D patients with the 
age group of 40-75 years. Prescriptions were audited for details of statin use 
and dose intensity. Descriptive analysis was performed using SPSS version 22.0.
RESULTS: We included a total of 323 study subjects. Of those, 55.7% study 
subjects were found to be received statin for their primary prevention of CVD. 
Commonly prescribed type of statins was simvastatin (37.2%), atorvastatin 
(32.8%) and rosuvastatin (15.6%). Low, moderate and high intensive dose of 
statins were prescribed in 27.8%, 46.1%, and 26.1%, respectively. Of those 
subjects received statin, 60.6% had on target cholesterol level. Overall, a 
significant percentage of subjects did not receive their recommended statin for 
primary prevention of CVD which is below the guidelines' recommendation. 
Therefore, adherence to guidelines may help to promote the use of statins for 
primary prevention of CVD in T2D and advance interventions to improve statin 
prescribing should be considered.

OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND: In 2015 approximately 5.0 million people were 
estimated to have died from diabetes. Poor glycemic control is the most 
determinant of diabetes-related complication and death. The percentage of 
patients whose blood glucose level are not well controlled remains high yet. The 
aim of this study is to identify the determinants of poor glycemic control at 
the diabetes clinic of the Jimma University Medical Center from April 01 to June 
30/2017.
METHODS: Facility-based case-control study design was conducted on patients with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus on follow-up at the diabetes clinic of Jimma University 
medical center. The consecutive sampling technique was employed and data were 
collected from April to June 2017. The data were entered using Epidata manager 
version 4.0.2 and exported to SPSS Version 21 for analysis. Logistic regression 
analysis was performed and variables with the p-value of less than 0.05 were 
considered as statistically significant determinants of poor glycemic control.
RESULT: The study was conducted on 410 patients, of which 228 males and 182 
females. The determinants of poor glycemic control were comorbidities [Adjusted 
odd ratio(AOR) = 2.56, 95%CI = 1.10-5.96], lack of self-monitoring blood glucose 
[AOR = 3.44,95%CI = 1.33-8.94], total cholesterol level of 200 mg/dl or more 
[AOR = 3.62, 95%CI = 1.46-8.97], diabetes duration of greater than 7 years 
[AOR = 3.08, 95%CI = 1.33-7.16], physical activity of three or less than three 
days [AOR = 4.79, 95%CI = 1.70-13.53], waist to hip ratio of 0.9 or greater for 
male and 0.85 or greater for female [AOR = 3.52, 95%CI = 1.23-10.11], being on 
metformin plus insulin [AOR = 9.22, 95%CI = 2.90-29.35] and being on insulin 
[AOR = 4.48, 95%CI = 1.52-13.16].
CONCLUSION: Lack of Self-monitoring blood glucose, presence of comorbidities, 
duration of diabetes mellitus, physical activity of three or less than three 
days, total cholesterol of 200 mg/dl or more, waist to hip ratio of 0.9 or 
greater for male and 0.85 or greater for female, and types of antidiabetic 
medication were the independent predictors of poor glycemic control. Effort 
should be made towards reducing these factors by the concerned body.

BACKGROUND: Poor adherence to the medical regimen is a major clinical problem in 
the management of patients with diabetes. This study sought to investigate the 
level of medication adherence to antidiabetic therapy and to identify possible 
predictors of poor adherence.
METHODS: A hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted from July 2018 to 
June 2019 among randomly selected follow-up T2D patients at a hospital diabetes 
clinic. Data were collected through patient interviews, followed by medical 
chart review. Adherence to antidiabetic therapy that we assessed patients' 
responses using validated Brief Medication Questionnaire (BMQ). To identify 
predictors of poor medication adherence, binary logistic regression analyses 
were performed using SPSS version 25. Statistical significance was set at p 
value ≤ 0.05.
RESULTS: Of the total 357 study participants, 25% were non-adherent to their 
antidiabetic therapy. Predictors statistically associated with poor adherence 
were; being female gender (AOR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.01-2.76), and presence of at 
least one diabetic complication (AOR = 2.02, 95% CI 1.02-3.22). Participants 
with having at least primary level of education were more likely to adhere to 
anti-diabetes medication (AOR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.18-0.96). The most common 
self-reported reasons for non-adherence were forgetfulness, unavailability of 
medication plus the unaffordability of anti-diabetes medications.
CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of participants' adherent to anti-diabetes therapies 
was suboptimal. Being female, the presence of chronic diabetic complications and 
having no formal education were the main predictors of poor adherence. 
Strategies that aimed at improving adherence to antidiabetic medications deemed 
to be compulsory.

BACKGROUND: Though many trials had examined the effectiveness of taking insulin 
with or without oral agents, there are limited real-world data, particularly 
among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the resource limited 
settings. This study aimed to examine level of glycemic control among patients 
with T2DM after initiation of insulin and factors associated with poor glycemic 
control.
METHODS: An analysis of retrospective medical records of patients with T2DM who 
initiated insulin due to uncontrolled hyperglycemia by oral agents was conducted 
from 2015-2020 in the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. 
Difference in median fasting plasma glucose (FPG) before and after insulin 
initiations was examined by a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Kruskal Wallis test was 
performed to explore difference in the median level of FPG among treatment 
groups. A logistic regression model was also used to identify associated factors 
of poor glycemic control after insulin initiation. Statistical significance was 
declared at p < 0.05.
RESULTS: Of 424 enrolled patients with T2DM, 54.7% were males and the mean age 
was 59.3±9.3 years. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that there was 
significant deference in FPG before and after insulin initiation (P < 0.001). A 
declining trend of blood glucose was observed during the 1-year follow-up period 
of post-initiation. However, majority of the participants did not achieve target 
glucose levels. Participants who had higher FPG and systolic blood pressure 
(SBP) before insulin initiation were found more likely to have poor glycemic 
control after insulin initiation. Similarly, patients who received atorvastatin 
compared with simvastatin were found to have poor glycemic control in the 
post-period of initiation (P = 0.04). Premixed insulin was associated with a 
lower likelihood of poor glycemic control than neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) 
insulin (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Following insulin initiation, a significant change in glycemic level 
and declining trend of FPG was observed during a 1-year follow-up period. 
However, the majority of patients still had a poorly controlled glycemic level. 
Appropriate management focusing on predictors of glycemic control would be of a 
great benefit to achieve glycemic control.

OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess magnitude and pattern of drug 
related problems among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and 
hypertension.
RESULTS: This study identified 364 drug related problems (DRPs) across the three 
categories of drug related problems, giving an average of 1.8 DRPs per patient. 
The effect of drug treatment being not optimal 179 (49.2%), untreated indication 
and symptoms 77 (21.1%), unnecessary drug-treatment 39 (10.7%) and adverse drug 
reactions 69 (19%) were the most frequent categories of DRPs identified. In 
general, high prevalence of drug-related problems was identified among patients 
with T2DM hypertension. The effect of drug treatment being not optimal, 
untreated indication and symptoms, unnecessary drug-treatment and adverse drug 
reactions were the most frequent categories of drug related problems identified. 
Therefore, the clinicians should work to improve patient care through prevention 
and resolving drug related problems since it can affect the quality of the care 
significantly.

OBJECTIVES: Systolic blood pressure rise among T2DM patients was main risk 
factor for cardiovascular disease. Objective of this study was to identify 
predictors of isolated systolic hypertension among T2DM patients at Jimma 
University Specialized Hospital, 2016. We conducted cross sectional study using 
simple random sampling and interviewer administered questionnaire. Isolated 
systolic hypertension is SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and < 90 mmHg. Data entered and analyzed 
using Epi Data and SPSS respectively. Predictor factor was declared at p < 0.05.
RESULTS: A total of 315 T2DM took part. Prevalence of ISH was 27.6% [95% CI 
(22.7, 32.5%)]. One hundred sixty and two (51.4%) patients were males with mean 
age of 54.1 from 22 to 87 years. Male sex [AOR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.21-4.72, 
p = 0.012], unemployment [AOR = 3.22, 95% CI 1.48-7.03, p = 0.003], age of 47-55 
[AOR = 2.63, 95% CI 1.03-6.70, p = 0.044], single [AOR = 2.26, 95% CI 1.13-4.51, 
p = 0.021], ≤ Grade 8 [AOR = 2.94, 95% CI 1.10-7.85, p = 0.03] and income (ETB) 
501-800 [AOR = 21.9, 95% CI 7.62-63.1, p < 0.001], 801-1500 [AOR = 5.78, 95% CI 
2.55-13.1, p < 0.001] and > 1500 [AOR = 4.23, 95% CI 1.74-10.30, p = 0.001] were 
significant factors of ISH. The health sector has to establish preventive 
strategies for ISH among T2DM patients by giving special attention to predictor 
factors.
